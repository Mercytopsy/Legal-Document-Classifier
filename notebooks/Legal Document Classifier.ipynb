O. Ighodalo J, in Suit No. B/413/2000 delivered on 14/4/2011.\\n\\u200bBy a Writ of Summons filed on 19/6/2000, the 1st Respondent as Claimant commenced an action against the Appellants as Defendants, and the 2nd Respondents claiming the&nbsp;following reliefs, to wit:1. A Declaration that the Plaintiff is both the legal and equitable owner of all that large piece or parcel of land measuring 928.804 Sq. Meters registered as No. 4 at page 4 in Volume 157 in the Land Registry and situate at R. S. Okeaya Inneh Estate Layout at Isiohor near Bendel Development and Planning Authority Housing Estate, Ugbowo, Benin City.\\n2. A Declaration that the Plaintiff is entitled to possession and statutory right of occupancy of the said piece of land measuring 928.804 square Meters delineated in Survey plan No. ISO/BD/09/88 within the larger areas of land of K.S. OKEAYA INNEH'S Estate Layout at Isiohor, near Bendel Development and Planning Authority housing Estate, Ugbowo, Benin City.\\n3. An Order of possession in respect of the land in favor of the Plaintiff.\\n4. A Declaration that any purported claim by way of sales from any person by the defendants is null and void.\\n5. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the Defendants either by themselves or their servants, and/or agents from dealing with the said land either by building or sales in a manner that is inconsistent with the legal rights&nbsp;and interests of the Plaintiff.\\n6. N5,000,000.00 as general damages for trespass into the land described in (a) above against the Defendants; and\\n7. Any other relief that may be proper in the interest of justice.&nbsp;\\n\\nThe gist of the case of the 1st Respondent as Claimant before the trial Court was that he bought and duly registered the land in dispute in 1972 from his predecessor in title, one Ibhafidon Aburimen, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 8/12/1970 and that he has since 1972 been in undisturbed possession and exercised several acts of ownership, including plotting out the land, conveying portions to several persons without let or hindrance before the unauthorized trespass into the land in dispute by the Appellants.\\n\\u200bOn the other hand, the gist of the case of the Appellants as 1st and 2nd Defendants before the trial Court&nbsp;was that they bought the land in dispute from their predecessor in title, one Ugiagbe Omoragbon, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 10/1/1970 and that they had to settle through the 2nd Respondent with one Miss Iraigonse Okeaya - Inneh, to whom it was alleged that the 1st Respondent had assigned the land in dispute to. They have since developed the land in dispute by building thereon and are in occupation of their house thereon.\\n\\u200bAt the Court below, the parties filed and exchanged their pleadings and the matter proceeded to hearing. At the close of their respective cases, learned counsel for&nbsp;the parties filed and adopted their final written addresses, as well as made oral submissions on the issue of the locus standi of the 1st Respondent to maintain the action against the Respondents.&nbsp;\\nOn 14/4/2011, the trial Court delivered its judgment in which the claims of the 1st Respondent as Claimant against the Appellants as Defendants were granted.&nbsp;\\nBeing dissatisfied with the decision of the trial Court, the Appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal.\\n\",\n          \"This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Katsina State holden at Funtua in Suit No. KTH/FT/135M/10, delivered on 14/2/2011 by Hon. Justice I.M. Bako.\\n\\nThe Respondent commenced an action at the Federal High Court Katsina, against Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye under the undefended list procedure claiming the sum of Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty-Six Thousand, Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50K) being the balance of payment due to the Respondent for carrying out sub-contract work of stone pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Ltd. Judgment was entered in favour of the Respondent and the Appellant being dissatisfied appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal in appeal No. CA/K/201/2008 allowed the appeal in a judgment delivered on 15th December, 2010, on the ground that the Federal High Court, Katsina, lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action; hence the judgment was set aside and the suit struck out. Consequently, the Respondent filed a fresh action before the High Court of Katsina State in Suit No: KTH/FT/135M/2010 under the undefended list procedure.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Respondent obtained the leave of Court to serve the originating processes on the Appellant outside jurisdiction and the bailiff of the trial Court served the writ of summons and accompanying affidavit with the order of the Court granting leave to serve outside jurisdiction (which was obtained ex parte) on the Appellant's secretary, one Miss Ebere Nge of Babington Ashaye &amp; Co. The bailiff of the trial Court filed a proof of service of the originating processes on the Appellant and also delivered the processes to the Appellant's Counsel at his chambers but no step was taken to file any notice of intention to defend the action. On 14th February, 2011, when the matter came up for hearing, the Appellant was absent and unrepresented by Counsel and no notice of intention to defend the action was filed by the Appellant. However, during the course of the proceedings, just when the Court was about pronouncing its judgment, counsel to the Appellant, Mr. O.A. Orewale Esq. arrived in Court very late and the judge refused to record the counsel's appearance. Upon a careful consideration of the Writ, the affidavit in support and Exhibits annexed and the oral submissions of Counsel to the Respondent, the High Court proceeded to enter judgment in favour of the Respondent for the sum of Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and Sixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50k) together with interest at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid. Sequel to the decision of the High Court, the Appellant as judgment debtor filed a motion dated 14th February, 2011, at the High Court praying the Court to set aside its judgment, which the Respondent's Counsel vehemently opposed in a counter affidavit among other issues that the Court had become functus officio and should dismiss the application. After a careful consideration, the High Court dismissed the application for lacking in merit. While the appeal was pending, the initial Appellant, Mr. Babington Ashaye died and the Appellant's Counsel filed an application dated 8th February, 2013, praying for leave to substitute Mr. Babington Ashaye with Mr. Babatunde Ajayi, who is the new Receiver of Stirling Civil Engineering Ltd. The application was granted by this Honourable Court on the 18th of June, 2013, and the notice of appeal was amended and filed accordingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nDissatisfied with the said judgment, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.\",\n          \"This appeal is against the judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Warri in Suit No. FHC/WR/CS/53/2015 delivered on 5th April 2016, coram Hon. Justice E.A Obile wherein the Court struck out the suit of the Appellant after the adoption of final written addresses of the parties on both the preliminary objections by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the substantive suit.\\n\\nThe summary of the case of the plaintiff/appellant against the defendants/respondents at the Federal High Court as can be gleaned from the amended originating summons is that both appellant, the 3rd respondent and other aspirants were contestants at primary election of the 2nd respondent, (Peoples Democratic Party) conducted on the 29th day of November 2014 seeking for the 2nd respondent's ticket to contest the 11th April 2015 general election to represent Ughelli South constituency of Delta State in the Delta State House of Assembly. The appellant claimed to have won the primary election at the end of poll and his name was forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission (1st Respondent) as the candidate of the 2nd respondent (PDP). According to him, his name was substituted with that of Mr. Reuben Izeze, the 3rd respondent. Efforts to get his name restored on the list of contestants who won the primary election of 2nd Respondent (PDP) met a brick wall and hence his suit against the Respondent at the Federal High Court.\\n\\nThe Appellant who was the plaintiff before the Federal High Court filed an originating summons on 9th April, 2015 wherein he claimed against all the Respondents who were defendants before the Federal High Court as follows:\\n\\\"(1) Whether the National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is empowered to conduct primaries and present candidates to the Delta State House of Assembly election scheduled for April 11, 2015 on behalf of the party.\\n(2) Whether the plaintiff having won and was issued the certificate of return as the winner of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency primary election conducted by the National Working Committee of the 2nd defendant can be surreptitiously substituted with the 3rd defendant by the 1st and 2nd defendants as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency elections in total disregard of the report of the 2nd defendant's electoral panel and electoral appeal committee for the conduct of the Delta State House of Assembly primaries held on the 29th day of November, 2014, the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\\\"\\n\\nHe sought for the following reliefs consequent upon the determination of the foregoing questions.\\n\\\"(1) A declaration that the plaintiff having won the received (sic) the certificate of result as the winner of the Ughelli South Constituency, Delta State House of Assembly primaries conducted by the National Working Committee of the 2nd defendant, is the rightful and lawful candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly election slated for the 11th day of April 2015.\\n(2) A declaration that the 1st and 2nd defendants' surreptitious substitution of the plaintiff's name with the 3rd defendant's name as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly Ughelli South Constituency election slated for the 11th day of April 2015 in total disregard of the result of the primaries, report of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) electoral panel is contrary to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) and therefore unlawful, illegal and of no effect whatsoever.\\n(3) A declaration that any step taken by the defendant in furtherance of the unlawful substitution of the plaintiff with the 3rd defendant is disregard (sic) of the result of the primaries conducted by the National Working Committee of the PDP, report of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Electoral Panel, the People Democratic Party Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) is a nullity.\\n(4) An order reinstating the name of the plaintiff as the lawful and rightful candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency election slated for the 11th day of April, 2015.\\n(5) An order nullifying the election of the 3rd defendant into the Delta State of Assembly, Ughelli South constituency held on the 11th day of April, 2015.\\n(6) An order nullifying and or setting aside the certificate of return issued by the 1st defendant to the 3rd defendant on the basis of the election held on 11th April 2015 on the ground that the said election amount to a nullity.\\n(7) An order directing the 1st defendant to issue a certificate of return to the plaintiff as the duly elected member of the Delta State House of Assembly representing Ughelli South constituency.\\n(8) An order directing the 3rd defendant to refund all monies, salaries, allowances and or benefits collected and received by him as a member representing Ughelli South constituency in the Delta State House of Assembly from the date (sic) swearing in until judgment is delivered.\\n(9) GENERAL DAMAGES\\nGeneral damages against the defendants jointly and severally in the sum of N500,000,000.00 (five hundred million naira).\\\"\\nRespective counsel after entering conditional appearance on behalf of their client (i.e. 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants) and joining issues with the Appellant also filed separate motions challenging the competence of the action by the Appellant and the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the suit. Issues were also joined by the Appellant on the 2nd and 3rd Defendants/Respondents notice of preliminary objections. After the adoption of written addresses on the preliminary objection and processes of respective party in the substantive originating summons, the Federal High Court on the 5th day of April 2016 delivered its considered judgment wherein it upheld the preliminary objections by the 2nd and 3rd respondents and struck out the suit of the appellant.&nbsp;Dissatisfied with the said judgment, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

(Delivering the Leading Judgment): This is an appeal against the Judgment of the High Court of Edo State, Benin Judicial Division Coram: M. O. Ighodalo J, in Suit No. B/413/2000: K. S. Okeaya-Inneh SAN V. Dr. Daniel Amu &amp; Ors., delivered on 14/4/2011, in which the claims of the 1st Respondent as Claimant against the Appellants and 2nd Respondent as Defendants were granted.\\n\\n\\u200bThe Appellant were thoroughly dissatisfied with the said Judgment and had appealed against it vide their Notice of Appeal filed on 9/5/2011 on four Grounds of appeal at pages 190 - 194 of the Record of Appeal. The Record of Appeal deemed as duly compiled and transmitted to this Court on 30/6/2021. An Amended Notice of Appeal was filed on 12/5/2014 on 11 Grounds of appeal with the leave of Court but was deemed as properly filed on 30/6/2021. The Appellant\\u2019s amended brief was filed on 12/8/2014 but was deemed as properly filed on 30/6/2021. The 1st Respondent\\u2019s brief was filed on 15/9/2017 but was deemed as properly filed on 30/6/2021. The 2nd Respondent, despite service of the Appellants\\u2019 brief on him, did not file any\\n1\\n Respondent\\u2019s brief. \\n\\nAt the hearing of this appeal on 30/6/2021, O. Ovrawah Esq., learned counsel for the Appellants, appearing with O. Odiase Esq, abandoned grounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 10 of the Amended Notice and Grounds of Appeal as well as issue five for determination, and adopted the Appellant\\u2019s amended brief as their arguments and urged the Court to allow the appeal and set aside the Judgment of the Court below and dismiss the claims of the 1st Respondent for lacking in merit. On their part, K. O. Obamogie Esq., learned counsel for the 1st Respondent, appearing with E. O. Ahamioje Esq., and M. O. Erhunmum Esq., adopted the 1st Respondent\\u2019s brief as their arguments and urged the Court to dismiss the appeal and affirm the Judgment of the Court below. The 2nd Respondent, though duly served with hearing notice on 28/6/2021, did not participate in the hearing of this appeal. \\n\\n\\u200bBy a Writ of Summons filed on 19/6/2000, the 1st Respondent as Claimant commenced an action against the Appellants as Defendants, and the 2nd Respondents who was joined on the application of the Appellants as 3rd Defendant on 29/2/2001 by the Court below, claiming the\\n\\n2\\n following reliefs, to wit: \\n1. A Declaration that the Plaintiff is both the legal and equitable owner of all that large piece or parcel of land measuring 928.804 Sq. Meters registered as No. 4 at page 4 in Volume 157 in the Land Registry and situate at R. S. Okeaya Inneh Estate Layout at Isiohor near Bendel Development and Planning Authority Housing Estate, Ugbowo, Benin City. \\n2. A Declaration that the Plaintiff is entitled to possession and statutory right of occupancy of the said piece of land measuring 928.804 square Meters delineated in Survey plan No. ISO/BD/09/88 within the larger areas of land of K.S. OKEAYA INNEH'S Estate Layout at Isiohor, near Bendel Development and Planning Authority housing Estate, Ugbowo, Benin City.\\n3. An Order of possession in respect of the land in favor of the Plaintiff.\\n4. A Declaration that any purported claim by way of sales from any person by the defendants is null and void.\\n5. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the Defendants either by themselves or their servants, and/or agents from dealing with the said land either by building or sales in a manner that is inconsistent with the legal rights\\n\\n3\\n and interests of the Plaintiff.\\n6. N5,000,000.00 as general damages for trespass into the land described in (a) above against the Defendants; and\\n7. Any other relief that may be proper in the interest of justice. See pages 1 - 14 of the Record of Appeal. \\n\\nBRIEF STATEMENT OF FACTS\\nOn the one hand, the gist of the case of the 1st Respondent as Claimant before the Court below as can be gleaned from the averments in his pleadings and evidence, both oral and documentary as in the Record of Appeal, was that he bought and duly registered the land in dispute in 1972 from his predecessor in title, one Ibhafidon Aburimen, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 8/12/1970 and that he has since 1972 been in undisturbed possession and exercised several acts of ownership, including plotting out the land, conveying portions to several persons without let or hindrance before the unauthorized trespass into the land in dispute by the Appellants. \\n\\n\\u200bOn the other hand, the gist of the case of the Appellants as 1st and 2nd Defendants before the Court below, as can be gleaned from the averments in their\\n\\n4\\n pleadings and evidence both oral and documentary as in the Record of Appeal, was that they bought the land in dispute from their predecessor in title, one Ugiagbe Omoragbon, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 10/1/1970 and that they had to settle through the 2nd Respondent with one Miss Iraigonse Okeaya - Inneh, to whom it was alleged that the 1st Respondent had assigned the land in dispute to. They have since developed the land in dispute by building thereon and are in occupation of their house thereon. \\n\\n\\u200bAt the Court below, the parties filed and exchanged their pleadings and the matter proceeded to hearing. In proof of his claims, the 1st Respondent as Claimant testified and called one witness and tendered several documents, which were admitted in evidence, as Exhibits and closed his case. In their defense, the Appellants as Defendants testified through the 2nd Appellant and called two witnesses and tendered some documents, which were admitted in evidence, as Exhibits and closed their case. The 2nd respondent testified for himself. At the close of their respective cases, learned counsel for\\n\\n5\\n the parties filed and adopted their final written addresses on 25/1/2010, as well as made oral submissions on the issue of the locus standi of the 1st Respondent to maintain the action against the Respondents. On 14/4/2011, the Court below delivered its judgment in which the claims of the 1st Respondent as Claimant against the Appellants as Defendants were granted. See pages 111 - 189 and 190 - 194 of the Record of Appeal. \\n\\nISSUES FOR DETERMINATION\\nIn the Appellants\\u2019 amended brief, four live issues were distilled as arising for determination from the surviving five amended grounds of appeal, namely; \\n1. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the 1st Respondent had proved his title to the land in dispute? (Distilled from Grounds 5 and 11)\\n2. Whether the 1st Respondent had proved that the land in dispute over which the Court below granted him a declaration of title actually measured 928.067 square meters? (Distilled from Ground 6)\\n3. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the Appellants failed to join issues with the 1st Respondent on the averments raised in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Statement of Claim and\\n\\n6\\n as a result held that the Appellants must be deemed to have admitted those averments? (Distilled from Ground 7)\\n4. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the issue of locus standi of the 1st Respondent to initiate the Suit was strange and cannot be accommodated by the Court at the stage it was raised and consequently, failed to consider it and reach a decision on it? (Distilled from Grounds 8 and 9) \\n\\nIn the 1st Respondent\\u2019s brief four live issues were distilled as arising for determination in this appeal, namely: \\n1. Whether the Court below was not right when it held that the 1st Respondent has proved his title to the land in dispute on the preponderance of evidence as required by law? (Distilled from Ground 5)\\n2. Whether the Court below was not right when it granted the 1st Respondent\\u2019s reliefs as per paragraph 17(1) and (2) of his 2nd Further Amended Statement of Claim? (Distilled from Ground 6)\\n3. Whether the Court below was not right when it held that the Appellants did not properly join issues with the 1st Respondent with respect to his averments contained in paragraphs 11 and 12 of 1st Respondent\\u2019s\\n\\n7\\n 2nd Further Amended Statement of Claim and that no evidence was led to contradict the averments? (Distilled from Ground 7)\\n4. Whether the 1st Respondent does not possess the locus standi to institute and maintain the Suit No. B/413/2000 leading to the instant appeal? (Distilled from Grounds 8 and 9)\\n\\nMy lords, at the hearing of this appeal on 30/6/2021, learned counsel for the Appellants withdrew Grounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 10 and 11 of the Amended Notice and Grounds of Appeal from which no issues for determination were formulated as well as his issue five for determination. In law, these grounds of appeal and issue for determination having been withdrawn are hereby deemed abandoned and consequently struck out. See&nbsp;West African Offshore Ltd V Ariri (2015) 18 NWLR (Pt. 1490) 177 @ pp. 193 - 194. \\n\\n\\u200bI have taken time to consider averments of the parties as well as the issues joined in their pleadings and the evidence, oral and documentary led by them as in the Record of Appeal. I have also considered the submissions of counsel to the parties in their respective briefs in the light of the findings and decisions reached in the judgment of the Court below. Upon\\n\\n8\\n an anxious consideration of all the above, I am of the view that the four issues as distilled in the Appellants\\u2019 amended brief represent the apt issues for determination in this appeal, a consideration of which would, in my view, invariably involve a consideration of the four issues distilled in the 1st Respondent\\u2019s brief. However, I shall first consider Appellants\\u2019 issue three along with 1st Respondent\\u2019s issue three. Thereafter, I shall consider Appellants\\u2019 issue four along with 1st Respondent\\u2019s issue four. Then, I shall consider Appellants\\u2019 issues one and two together with 1st Respondent\\u2019s issues one and two and resolve all these issues in one fell swoop. \\n\\nISSUE THREE\\nWhether the Court below was right when it held that the Appellants failed to join issues with the 1st Respondent on the averments raised in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Statement of Claim and as a result held that the Appellants must be deemed to have admitted those averments? \\n\\nAPPELLANTS\\u2019 COUNSEL SUBMISSIONS\\nOn issue three learned counsel for the Appellants had submitted that the Court below was in grave error when it\\n\\n9\\n held that the Appellants did not deny the averments of the 1st Respondent in paragraphs 11 and 12 of his 2nd Amended Statement of Claim to the effect that he had at different times assigned Plot 34 to two persons, namely; Mr. Adaze Wilson Imafidon and Miss Iriagbonse Durojayi Okeaya-Inneh in error and that he had written a letter to Mr. Adaze Imafidon that he would allocate another parcel of land to him in replacement, a fact of which apart from Exhibits H and J, the 1st Respondent did not even lead any credible evidence in proof of thereof, and in law is deemed to have been abandoned and going to no issue, and contended that the Appellants directly and effectively denied these averments and maintained that they did not buy the land in dispute, Plot 35 from Mr. Adaze Imafidon but from one Miss Okeaya-Inneh through the 2nd Respondent and urged the Court to set aside the perverse finding that the Appellants were deemed to have admitted the averments in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s 2nd Amended Statement of Claim and to allow the appeal and dismiss the claims of the 1st Respondent for lacking in merit. \\n\\n\\u200bIt was also submitted that it was\\n\\n10\\n common ground between the parties that the land in dispute was Plot 35 and not Plot 34 in the 1st Respondent\\u2019s layout and contended that in the circumstances of the pleadings and the issues as joined by the parties it is clear that any matter or facts related to an alleged error in the allotment of Plot 34, a fact clearly within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent, of which the Appellants are not even in position to deny, to any person was never an issue, as no such issue was joined by the parties in their pleadings, which ought to have been considered holistically, in the case as presented and defended by the parties before the Court below and urged the Court to hold that the Appellants having responded to and denied the material averments in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s 2nd Amended Statement of Claim, the Court below was wrong to hold that the Appellants failed to deny those averments and were thus deemed to have admitted them and to set aside such irrelevant and perverse findings and allow the appeal and dismiss the claims of the 1st Respondent for lacking in merit. Counsel relied on Aja V. Okoro (1991) 7 NWLR (Pt. 203)&nbsp;260 @ p. 282.\\n\\n\\n11\\n1ST RESPONDENT\\u2019S COUNSEL SUBMISSIONS\\nOn his issue three, learned counsel for the 1st Respondent had submitted that Ground 7 of the Notice of Appeal and issue No. 3 emanating therefrom do not have any utilitarian value to the appeal of the Appellants in that Exhibit H does not relate to the land in dispute but rather relates to the land in dispute in a different land, Plot 34 and to a different case in Suit No. B/414/2000: Kola S. Okeaya-Inneh v Dr. Daniel Amu &amp; Anor and contended that the statement of the Court below on the issue of locus standi now being challenged in this appeal was of no moment in the determination of this appeal as it relates to a different Plot of land, Plot 34 and not to Plot 35 that is the land in dispute in this appeal and urged the Court to hold that issue three is merely academic since in law it is the ratio of a decision that a party is entitled to appeal against and not every statement or pronouncement made by the Court below and to dismiss the appeal for lacking in merit. Counsel relied on Peterside V. Wabara (2011) 6 NWLR (Pt. 1243) 328 @ pp. 337 - 338; Onafowokan V. Wema Bank Plc (2011) 12 NWLR\\n\\n12\\n (Pt. 1260) 24 @ p. 39; Daniel V.

Dairo (2015) 6 NWLR (Pt. 1454) 141 @ pp. 181 - 182. \\n\\nRESOLUTION OF ISSUE THREE\\nMy lords, it has been contended for the 1st Respondent that issue three for determination is merely academic and therefore, not worthy of any consideration and determination by this Court in this appeal in that it relates to matter which were not part of the facts on which issues were joined by the parties in this case before the Court below and thus, its determination one way or the other would be of no effect on the outcome of this appeal.\\n\\nNow issue three for determination in this appeal was stated to have been distilled from Ground 7 of the Amended Notice and Grounds of Appeal challenging the following pronouncement of the Court below in its judgment, namely: \\n\\u201cFurthermore, there are pleadings in the Plaintiff\\u2019s Statement of Claim that the said letters Exhibits H and H1 were written to the 1st and 2nd Defendants in respect of Plot 34 which had inadvertently been&nbsp;earlier assigned to Mr. Adaze Wilson and\\n\\n13\\n Iriagbonse Okeaya-Inneh and not Plot 35 which is the subject matter of the present suit. The Defendant did not properly join issues on the Plaintiff\\u2019s assertion in his pleadings on this issue and no evidence was lead to contradict the averments of the Plaintiff in the substance of the pleadings. It is therefore presumed that the Plaintiff averments in the said paragraphs 11 and 12 of his 2nd Amended Statement of Claim were admitted by the 1st and 2nd Defendants and thus established as what is admitted need no&nbsp;further proof.\\u201d See pages 185 - 186 of the Record of Appeal \\n\\nLooking at the pronouncement of the Court below on the averments of the parties and evidence led or not led in relation to Exhibit H, it would appear, and I so hold, that not only did the Court below found against the Appellants that they had admitted these averments of the 1st Respondent but it also based some of its crucial findings of fact as regards whether Exhibit H relates to the land in dispute, Plot 35 or to another land, Plot 34 and whether or not the error occasioned by Exhibit H was subsequently corrected by the 1st Respondent. These are some of the crucial findings\\n\\n14\\n that led ultimately to the decision of the Court below awarding title to the 1st Respondent against the Appellant in respect of Plot 35, which is the land in dispute in the case before the Court below and holding that the Appellants did not discredit or controvert the averments in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s 2nd Amended Statement of Claim relating to Exhibit H. \\n\\n\\u200bIn the light of the above, is issue three for determination in this appeal dealing with whether Exhibit H relates to Plot 34 or Plot 35 merely academic and therefore, not deserving of any consideration and determination in this appeal in that is not an appeal against any ratio in the decision of the Court below? I think not! So, would a determination of issue three for determination in this appeal as to whether or not the Appellants admitted Exhibit H relates to Plot 34, a land not in dispute in this case, and not to Plot 35, the land in dispute in this case, in any way affect crucially the decision of this Court in this appeal one way or the other? I think so! The reason for this is not farfetched, and it is simply that if Exhibit H is found to relate to Plot 35 then it\\n\\n15\\n would have a crucial effect on the determination of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s locus standi to institute and maintain the Suit against the Appellants before the Court below. However, if it is found not to relate to Plot 35 but relates to Plot 34, then of course it would be of no moment to this appeal since a determination of such as issue in relation to Plot 34 would have no effect whatsoever on the outcome of this appeal and would thus amount to a mere academic issue, which this Court would have no business concerning itself with in this appeal. \\n\\nIn law, an issue is said to be academic once it is no longer of any utilitarian value to the determination of the appeal one way or the other. In other words, its determination is not necessary for the effective determination of the live issues in an appeal. Indeed, Courts of law are loath to considering and resolving merely academic questions in their judgments since such determination would not serve any useful purpose.

Mimiko (No. 1) (2014) 1 NWLR (Pt. 1388) 225 @ pp. 254 - 255.\\n\\nIt follows therefore and I so hold, that the contention by the 1st Respondent that issue three for determination is merely academic is not well founded and it is hereby accordingly&nbsp;discountenanced. Having held that issue three for determination is not academic but one worthy of due consideration and resolution in this appeal, I shall proceed to consider and resolve it anon.\\n\\n\\u200bI have taken time to review the averments of the 1st Respondent in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the 2nd Amended Statement of Claim. I have also reviewed the averments of the Appellants in paragraph 14 of their Joint Amended Statement of Defense. I have also taken time to holistically review the entirety of the averments in the pleadings of the parties as in the Record of Appeal. I find the pronouncement of the Court below that the Appellants did not deny the averments of the 1st Respondent in paragraphs 11 and 12 of his 2nd Amended Statement of Claim, to the effect that he had at different times assigned Plot 34 to two persons, namely; Mr. Adaze Wilson\\n17\\n Imafidon and Miss Iriagbonse Durojayi Okeaya-Inneh in error and that he wrote a letter to Mr. Adaze Imafidon that he would allocate another parcel of land to him in replacement, a fact of which apart from Exhibits H and J, the 1st Respondent did not even lead any credible evidence in proof of thereof, and in law is deemed to have been abandoned and going to no issue, as erroneous on both the facts and in law. \\n\\n\\u200bNow, not only did the Appellants directly and effectively denied these averments and maintained that they did not re - purchase the land in dispute, Plot 35 from Mr. Adaze Imafidon but from one Miss Okeaya-Inneh through the 2nd Respondent, but they also rightly stated that they were not in position to admit or deny facts which were completely within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent. It is true in law that a denial must be direct and positive with detail of particulars of denial to amount to effective traverse, yet one party is not under any duty to positively deny facts which are squarely within the personal knowledge of the other party. He may put the other party to strict proof of facts averred as within his own personal knowledge. See\\n\\n18\\n Aja V. Okoro (1991) 7 NWLR (Pt. 203) 260 @ p. 282,&nbsp;where the Supreme Court had per Akpata JSC., stated inter alia thus: \\n\\u201c...It will, in my view be encouraging a Defendant to be mendacious to insist that he must deny flatly the fact of something he knows nothing about.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u200bMy lords, it was common ground between the parties that the land in dispute was Plot 35 and not Plot 34. On the pleadings and evidence led, issues were clearly and seriously joined between the parties as to the ownership of Plot 35, the land in dispute as between the 1st Respondent and the Appellants and Exhibit H was relevant, pleaded, relied upon and tendered in evidence as relating to Plot 35 as evidence of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s actions as Solicitors to the persons named in Exhibit H and written to the Appellants regarding their alleged trespass to the lands, amongst others, Plot 35, the land in dispute alleged to belong to the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Clients. Thus, the fact that Exhibit H had also earlier been tendered in evidence in another Suit No. B/414/2000 between the same parties in respect of Plot 34 rather lends credence to the fact that Exhibit H was written\\n\\n19\\n to the Appellants by the 1st Respondent in his capacity merely as Solicitor in respects of lands, not just one land, belonging to two of his Clients as was made even more clearer in Exhibit V, also written by the 1st Respondent to the Appellants\\u2019 Solicitors in response to Exhibit J. The contents of Exhibit H, as well as Exhibit V, speaks for itself and in law cannot be varied or contradicted by oral evidence of the 1st Respondent. \\n\\nIt is therefore&nbsp;clear to me that any matter or facts pleaded by the 1st Respondent to his alleged error in the allotment of Plot 34 not in dispute in this case to any person is a fact clearly within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent, of which the Appellants are not in a position to deny. Indeed such an issue was never an issue, as no such issue was joined by the parties in their pleadings. In my view, the Court below failed to consider the pleadings of the parties holistically as it is enjoined so to do by law to appreciate the totality of the respective cases of the parties as presented and defended by them. \\n\\nI find therefore, that the Appellants&nbsp;responded to and denied the material averments in\\n\\n20\\n paragraphs 11 and 12 of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s 2nd Amended Statement of Claim to the extent that they can possibly respond leaving out what was entirely within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent to prove same strictly by cogent and credible evidence at the trial before the Court below. It follows therefore and I so hold firmly, that the Court below was wrong when it held erroneously that the Appellants failed to deny the averments of the 1st Respondent in paragraph 11 and 12 of the 2nd Amended Statement of Claim, all of which material averments were in my finding effectively traversed leaving out those facts within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent to be proved strictly by him. Indeed it would amount to encouraging the Appellants to be mendacious to insist that they must deny flatly the fact of something they know nothing about and which was squarely within the personal knowledge of the 1st Respondent. See. Aja V. Okoro (1991) 7 NWLR (Pt. 203) 260 @ p. 282.\\n\\n\\u200bIn the light of all I have stated and held as above, issue three for determination is hereby resolved in favor of the Appellants against the 1st Respondent.\\n\\n21\\nISSUE FOUR\\nWhether the Court below was right when it held that the issue of locus standi of the 1st Respondent to initiate the Suit was strange and cannot be accommodated by the Court at the stage it was raised and consequently, failed to consider it and reach a decision on it? \\n\\nAPPELLANTS\\u2019 COUNSEL SUBMISSIONS \\nOn issue four, learned counsel for the Appellants had submitted that the 1st Respondent\\u2019s case was that he is the owner of the land in dispute, plot 35 situate in his Estate Layout and contended that by Exhibit H dated 10/11/1997, a letter written by the 1st Respondent to the Appellants, the 1st Respondent who described himself as the \\u2018original land owner\\u2019 stated categorically that he had disposed of his legal interest in the land in dispute to his Clients as named therein, namely; Adaze Wilson Imafidon and Iriagbonse Okeaya-Inneh and contended that on the face of the averments and evidence led by the 1st Respondent he lacked the locus standi to institute and maintain the action against the Appellants and urged the Court to hold that the Court below gravely erred when it failed to consider and resolve the jurisdictional issue of\\n\\n22\\n the competence of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Suit, which in law can be raised at any stage of the proceedings and must be resolved first once raised, and to hold further that the 1st Respondent lacked the locus standi to institute the action against the Appellants and allow the appeal, set aside the perverse judgment of the Court below and strike out the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Suit for being incompetent.

Nkemdilim (1962) 1 All NLR (Pt.4) 587.\\n\\nIt was also submitted that the 1st Respondent instituted the Suit in his name and in his personal capacity as the Claimant and not under any legally recognized authority such as a donee of a power of attorney from his Clients whom he stated in Exhibit H to be the owners of the land in dispute and contended that in law since the 1st Respondent had admitted to have disposed of his entire legal interest in the land in dispute he therefore, had no legal\\n\\n23\\n interest to protect and no cause of action to institute the action in his own right as a Claimant against the Appellants and urged the Court to so hold and to allow the appeal and set aside the perverse judgment of the Court below and strike out the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Suit for being incompetent.

Counsel relied on Adesanya V. President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1981) 5 SC 12; Amadi V. Essien (1994) 7 NWLR (Pt. 354) 91 @ p. 115; Ilori V.

Oduwaiye (2014) 6 NWLR (Pt. 1404) 427 @ p. 443. \\n\\nIt was also submitted that there was nothing in either the pleadings and/or the evidence of the Appellants, if that can even\\n\\n25\\n be looked at in law in considering the locus standi of the 1st Respondent, to support the weak and baseless contention of the Appellants that the 1st Respondent lacked the locus standi to institute the Suit and contended that in the circumstances, it was surprisingly for the Appellants to raise the issue of 1st Respondent\\u2019s locus standi in their final address before the Court below and urged the Court to hold that the Court below was right and on firm ground when it held that the procedure adopted by the Appellants was strange and amounted to a legal ambush and to dismiss the appeal for lacking in merit and affirm the judgment of the Court below. \\n\\nRESOLUTION OF ISSUE FOUR\\nMy lord, in law the term \\u2018locus standi\\u2019, though expressed in Latin, simply refers to the legal capacity of a party to institute proceedings in a Court of law. Thus, all that a Claimant need to do to establish his locus standi is to succinctly plead in his pleadings the entire or sufficient facts establishing his rights and obligations, including or showing all the key elements of locus standi, namely: violation of civil rights and obligations, sufficient interest\\n\\n26\\n in the matter and how the interest arose; justiciable enforceable action, all culminating into showing the existence of dispute between the parties. Once, these facts are evident or apparent in the pleadings of a Claimant the issue of locus standi is settled in favor of such a Claimant. In B.B. Apugo &amp; Sons Ltd V. Orthopaedic Hospitals Management Board (2016) 13 NWLR (Pt. 1529) 206 @ p. 269, the Supreme Court had reiterated inter alia thus: \\n\\\"A person has locus standi to sue in an action if he is able to show to the satisfaction of the Court that his civil rights and obligations have been or are in danger of being infringed\\u2026\\u2026To have locus standi the Plaintiff\\u2019s Statement of Claim must disclose sufficient legal interest, and show how such interest arose in the subject matter of the action\\u2026He has locus standi if he can show that he has a stake in the subject matter or outcome of the case, and must be able to establish that what he suffers or the injury to his person was the consequence of the Defendant\\u2019s act or conduct.\\\" \\nSee also Orogan V.

Olufosoye (1986) 1 NWLR (Pt. 18) 669. \\n\\nGenerally locus standi is an equitable plea and therefore, must be pleaded and raised in the pleadings of the defendant before it could be countenanced and determined either in limine as a preliminary issue or along with the substantive trial. However, over the years the issue of locus standi has been elevated to a threshold issue of jurisdiction, and therefore, can be raised at any stage of the proceedings and once raised, and being a jurisdictional issue, it is the law that it must be considered and determined by the Court before which it was raised one way or the other before the merit or otherwise of the substantive suit can be determined.

The Plaintiff avers that no matter the nature or extent of the trespass carried out on the land in dispute, he will at the trial give evidence to show that the acts of the defendants are wholly and inconsistent with his legal and equitable right/interest.\\n15. The 1st and 2nd Defendants deliberately and with utter disregard to the lawful title, possession, interest and right of the Plaintiff embarked on the development of the land with impunity.\\n16. The Plaintiff will contend at the trial that the deliberate acts of the 1st and 2nd Defendants in developing the land and now occupying the same is from the beginning unlawful, unwarranted and amounts to utter defiance of the Plaintiff\\u2019s lawful title, both in law, custom and equity to all intents and purposes.\\u201d See pages 5 - 6 of the Record of Appeal.\\n\\nMy lords, I have already found as fact whilst considering issue three for determination that Exhibit H was written by the 1st Respondent to the Appellants in relation to amongst others, the land in dispute in\\n\\n29\\n Plot 35. From the above averments, it is clear that the 1st Respondent had instituted the action against the Appellants before the Court below in his own right. At the trial several documents were tendered by the parties and admitted in evidence as Exhibits, out of which I find the following Exhibits are very instructive and relevant for the purposes of determining the issue dealing with the 1st Respondent\\u2019s locus standi. \\n\\nThere is Exhibit H which is same as Exhibit T. It is a letter dated 10/11/1997 and written by the Law Firm of the 1st Respondent and signed by one O. F. Asemokhai Esq., Solicitor, and addressed to the Appellants, stating inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cWe write to you as Solicitors to Mr. Adaze Imafidon\\u2026 and Miss Iriagbons Okeaya-Inneh\\u2026 referred to as our Clients. This letter is issued on our Clients\\u2019 full briefing and instruction. We have information that both of you have unlawfully encroached into our Clients\\u2019 land situate at&nbsp;Okeaya - Inneh Layout, Isiohor near Ugbowo Housing Estate Ugbowo, Benin City\\u2026 Be that as it may, we cannot stand by on our side and watch you taking advantage of our Clients not\\n\\n30\\n being in the Country to unlawfully and clandestinely take over their lands. This can never be as we are not known to ever compromise our Clients\\u2019 position in all material particular. Now therefore, take notice that our Clients have asked us to warn both of you on a final note to immediately vacate the above said land and to dismantle and remove any structure or structures you may have erected thereon.\\u201d\\n\\nThere is also Exhibit J, which is same as Exhibit U. It is a letter dated 26/11/1997 and written by the Law Firm of R. I. Ogbebor &amp; Co, Solicitors to the Appellants in response to Exhibit H, in which the land in dispute was described as belonging to Mr. Adaze Imafidon and Miss Iriagbonse Okeaya - Inneh and stating that the Appellants had some years before 1997, when Exhibit H was written to them already built and are in occupation of their house on the land in dispute. \\n\\n\\u200bThere is yet another document tendered as Exhibit V dated 21/6/1999, and titled \\u201cRe: Trespass to land at Ugbowo Benin City; 1. Land of Mr. Adaze Imafidon; 2. Land of Miss Iriagbonse Okeaya-Inneh\\u201d from the Law Firm of the 1st Respondent to the Solicitors to\\n\\n31\\n the Appellants and signed by the 1st Respondent, stating inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cThat I am the original owner of the respective parcel of land within a larger parcel of land over the years (about 15 hectares) out of it I subsequently assigned to the above mentioned Assignees\\u2026 As the last opportunity I shall be grateful to hear from you or respectfully see you and your Clients on or before the end of August 1999 to put an end to this dispute amicably as suggested earlier, failing which I shall be compelled in accordance with the instructions of the Assignees to resort to unpleasant Court action.\\u201d\\n\\nMy lord, it would appear that it was on the face of the above pleadings of the 1st Respondent and the documentary evidence led before the Court below that the Appellants had raised the issue of the locus standi of the 1st Respondent before the Court below and on 25/1/2010 it ordered the parties to address it orally, which they both did through their respective learned counsel. See pages 70- 93 of the Record of Appeal. \\n \\n\\u200bHowever, in its judgment delivered on 14/4/2011, the Court below had on the issue of locus standi stated and held inter\\n\\n32\\n alia thus: \\n\\u201c...The defense counsel raised by his address the issue of the locus standi of the Plaintiff to institute this action relying on Exhibits H, H1 and \\u201cJ\\u201d in these proceedings. My short answer to this issue raised by learned counsel is that it cannot be raised at this stage of the proceedings when all the evidence has been led and parties have closed their respective cases. It amounts to legal ambush and this honorable Court will not allow it. This is because the procedure adopted flagrantly and violently violates the Plaintiff\\u2019s fundamental human right to fair hearing as issues were not joined on it. Issues bordering on locus standi are usually raised by way of preliminary objections and the issue set down for hearing. After hearing arguments from both sides the Court can then validly rule on the issue. The procedure adopted by the learned counsel is therefore&nbsp;strange and cannot be accommodated by this honorable Court\\u201d. See page 185 of the Record of Appeal. \\n\\n\\u200bIt is the vehement contention of the Appellants that the 1st Respondent having by his own showing vide Exhibit H admitted to have disposed of and divested\\n\\n33\\n himself of any proprietary right in the land in dispute, Plot 35, in favor of his Client/Sister one Miss Erigbonse Okeaya-Inneh, no longer has any capacity or authority to institute an action in his own name and not as an attorney for and or on behalf of his Client/Sister, the alleged owner on his own admission and thereby rendered the entire action incompetent by reason of his lack of the requisite locus standi to maintain the action in his own name. \\n\\n\\u200bOn the other hand, it was also vehemently contended for the 1st Respondent that he remained the owner of the land in dispute, Plot 35, having not at any time disposed of and transferred ownership of same to his Clients, Mr. Adaze Imafidon and Miss Erigbonse Okeaya - Inneh in the absence of any document of transfer of his title to any of these person and that Exhibit H was in respect of Plot 34 having no bearing with Plot 35 the land in dispute in this appeal and that at any rate, Exhibit H is not a document transferring the 1st Respondent\\u2019s interest in the land in dispute to any of these two persons as erroneously contended by the Appellants and that the 1st Respondent having therefore, never divested\\n\\n34\\n himself of his ownership to the land in dispute, possesses the requisite locus standi to institute and maintain the action against the Appellants. \\n\\nMy lords, in cases in which the contentions of parties on an issue are divergent both by their pleadings and evidence led thereon, but there are documentary evidence tendered by them, it is the law, that since parties are bound by the documents tendered by them in evidence and are thus obliged to either swim or sink with the contents of such documents tendered by them, such documentary evidence can be used as hangers on which to assess the veracity of the oral evidence led by the parties. In law documents are the barometer with which the truth of oral evidence can be safely measured. See Kimdey V. Military Governor, Gongola State (1988) 2 NWLR (Pt. 77) 445. See also Fashanu V.

U and V, as well as the submissions of learned counsel for the parties, in the light of the decision of the Court below on the issue of the locus standi of the 1st Respondent, on the face of the above very direct and categorical statements of the 1st Respondent, to the effect that he has long divested himself of any proprietary right in the land in dispute in favor of his Clients, Mr. Adaze Imafidon and Miss Erigbonse Okeaya-Inneh and on whose behalf he was in correspondence with the Appellants as Solicitors in Exhibits H and V, and acting on their instruction and behalf, that I find the contention by the Appellants that the Court below was in grave error when it whimsically and without any legal validity refused, declined and/or neglected to consider and resolve the issue of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s locus standi to institute the action against the Appellants, merely on the untenable ground, as flimsy as it was, that an issue touching on the competence of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s suit, hence raising a threshold issue of jurisdiction, was raised too late in the proceedings to be accorded any determination. \\n\\n\\u200bIn my finding, the Court\\n\\n36\\n below was in grave error when it refused, failed and neglected to consider and determine the issue of locus standi of the 1st Respondent for which it called for oral addresses from learned counsel for the parties on the lame excuse that it was raised too late in the day. In law an issue of jurisdiction can never be raised too late in the day.&nbsp;It is always on time whenever it is raised since it is better that a Court decides on the competence of the matter before it first than proceeding to determine on the merit a matter lacking in competence, which would amount to nothing but an exercise in futility. In Osafile V. Odi (1990) 3 NWLR (Pt. 137) 130, the Supreme Court had pronounced with finality inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cA Court is bound to consider the case validly presented to it by parties before it. A refusal to do so on any pretext, except on a ground of law will amount to a denial of the right to hear such party, a ground fundamental to the administration of justice, the breach of which is fatal.\\u201d\\nSee also Bellview Airlines Limited V.

V.&nbsp;National Security Adviser &amp; Anor (2018) LPELR - 45528 (CA), per Georgewill JCA. \\n\\nSo, can it be said that on the averments of the 1st Respondent himself in his 2nd Further Amended Statement of Claim and&nbsp;in light of the contents of Exhibits H, T, J, U and V, the 1st Respondent disclosed his locus standi to institute and maintain the action against the Appellants? I think not.&nbsp;In my finding taking all the averments in the 1st Respondent\\u2019s 2nd Further Amended Statement of Claim together along with Exhibits H, T, J, U and V, the 1st Respondent failed woefully to disclose any locus standi residing in him to institute and maintain the Suit No. No. B/413/2000: K. S. Okeaya - Inneh SAN V. Dr. Daniel Amu &amp;Ors., before the Court below. It follows therefore, and I so firmly hold, that Suit No. B/413/2000: K. S. Okeaya - Inneh SAN V. Dr. Daniel Amu &amp; Ors., is clearly incompetent and ought to have been struck out by the Court below.\\n\\n\\u200bI find the arguments by the 1st Respondent that Exhibit H does not amount to a document of transfer of title as bunkum, insincere and therefore, most unavailing to him. It was not the Appellants that said he had\\n\\n38\\n divested himself of his interest in the land in dispute, Plot 35 but it was him who had on his own volition and on his own showing said so not once but twice as in Exhibit H and in Exhibit V, where in response to Exhibit J, the reply from the Solicitors to the Appellants to his letter in Exhibit H, he had re - emphasized inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cThat I am the original owner of the respective parcel of land within a larger parcel of land over the years (about 15 hectares) out of it I subsequently assigned to the above mentioned Assignees\\u2026.to put an end to this dispute amicably as suggested earlier, failing which I shall be compelled in accordance with the instructions of the Assignees to resort to unpleasant Court action.\\u201d\\n\\nWhat else does the 1st Respondent want the Appellants to rely upon to raise the issue of his lack of locus standi to institute the action against them having told them by himself in Exhibits H and V that the land in dispute no longer belonged to him but belonged to his assignees, his Clients on whose instruction and behalf he wrote to the Appellants? Nothing else I can find! The 1st Respondent cannot be allowed to blow\\n\\n39\\n hot and cold as the same time and to approbate and reprobate on an issue he had so categorically conveyed to the Appellants in Exhibits H and V. The Appellants do not need any document of transfer of title to raise the issue of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s locus standi on the face of Exhibits H and V. See&nbsp;Ogunsakin V. Ajidara (2010) All FWLR (Pt. 507) 109 @ p. 129, where this Court per Denton-West JCA., had stated inter alia thus: \\n\\\"A party who has tendered a document in Court and admitted as an Exhibit cannot disassociate&nbsp;himself from a portion of the document and associate himself with the other portion. He cannot do so. Both law and equity will not allow him to do so. A party who has tendered a document in a Court of law and admitted as an Exhibit will at the end of the litigation either sail joyfully with it in the boat of victory or sink sorrowfully with it in the boat of defeat. He cannot be a beneficiary of both at the same time\\u201d\\nSee also Attorney General, Enugu State V. AVOP Plc. (1995) 6 NWLR (Pt. 399) 90. \\n\\u200bIn law, no party to an action before a Court of law has the liberty to be so inconsistent on the same issue and to so brazenly\\n\\n40\\n approbate and reprobate under any disguise of legal submissions. No wonder, documentary evidence, being earlier in time, more permanent and not so easily susceptible to manipulation, has come to stay to act as hangers on which to assess veracity of oral evidence. Indeed, consistency is the hallmark of honesty and truth. See&nbsp;Salawu Ajide V. Kadiri Kelani (1985) 2 NWLR (Pt. 12) 248. See also Governor of Lagos State &amp; Ors V. Ohaigo Nig.

S. Okeaya - Inneh SAN V. Dr. Daniel Amu &amp; Ors., is grossly incompetent. Thus, this appeal succeeds even on ground of issue four alone and the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Suit is therefore&nbsp;liable to be struck out. Consequently, Suit No. B/413/2000: K. S. Okeaya - Inneh SAN V. Dr. Daniel Amu &amp; Ors, is hereby struck out for being incompetent. \\n\\n\\u200bMy lords, having resolved issue four for determination in favor of the Appellants and holding firmly that the Court\\n\\n41\\n below erred in its refusal to consider the issue of locus standi after calling for and receiving oral addresses from learned counsel for the parties and further that the 1st Respondent having on his showing divested himself of his proprietary interest in the land in dispute, plot 35, thereby lacked the locus standi, the capacity to institute and maintain the action against the Appellants, and thereby finding the 1st Respondent\\u2019 Suit to be incompetent and thus liable to be struck out, there was really nothing further to consider in issues one and two for determination. These issues are no longer live issues but at best they have become merely academic. Courts of law are loath to considering and resolving merely academic questions in their judgments. In Charles Oke &amp; Anor V. Dr. Rahman Mimiko &amp; Ors (2013) All FWLR (Pt. 693) 1853, the full Court of the Supreme Court per Muhammad JSC, had this to say on this issue: \\n\\u201cIt is a principle of law long settled that the general attitude of the Courts of law is that they are loathe in making pronouncements on academic/hypothetical issues as it does not serve any useful purpose.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n42\\nSee&nbsp;also&nbsp;Uba Plc V.

Counsel relied on Enabulele V. Agbonlahor (1999) 4 NWLR (Pt. 598) 166; Aigbe V. Edokpolor (1977) 2 SC 1; Awoyegbe V. Ogbeide (1988) 1 NWLR (Pt. 73) 695. \\n\\n\\u200bIt was also submitted that the Court below was wrong when it held that the fact of registration of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Vendor\\u2019s title to land conferred on him as the purchaser legal title to the land in dispute and a notice to the whole world that he is the legal owner of the land in dispute and contended that it was common ground between the parties that they both acquired title to the land in dispute under the Benin Native Law and Custom and therefore, the issue of registration of title to the land did not arise under the Benin Native Law and Custom and urged the Court to hold that the fact of the registration of the 1st Respondent\\u2019s predecessor\\u2019s defective title was of no moment since\\n\\n45\\n under the Benin Native Law and Custom priority and validity in land acquisition is determined by the date of the Oba\\u2019s approval and to allow the appeal, set aside the perverse judgment of the Court below and dismiss the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Suit for lacking in merit. Counsel referred to Sections 16, 17 and 18 of the Evidence Act 2011. \\n\\nOn issue two, learned counsel for the Appellants had submitted that the PW1, the Surveyor to the 1st Respondent admitted that in Exhibit G, part of the land in dispute, Plot 35 was outside the land of the 1st Respondent, a fact also confirmed by Exhibit O of the Appellants and the evidence of their Surveyor and contended that this piece of evidence was a serious contradiction and clearly inconsistent with the case of the 1st Respondent that he owns the entire land in dispute, Plot 35 and urged the Court to hold that the Court below fell into grave error when it held and found for the 1st Respondent that he had proved his title to the land in dispute measuring 928.067 Square meters contrary to the evidence of his own Surveyor since in law, evidence at variance with the pleadings goes to no issue as it proves nothing and\\n\\n46\\n to set aside this perverse finding, allow the appeal and dismiss the unproved claims of the 1st Respondent for lacking in merit.

Thus, where a trial Court fails in this duty then it fails it its entire duty of impartial adjudication between the contending parties before it and the appellate Court if so moved is under a bounden duty to intervene to evaluate the evidence as in the record and make relevant findings and reach appropriate decisions as borne out by the evidence in the interest of justice to the parties. See Olufosoye V. Olorunfemi (1989) 1 SC (Pt. 1) 29. See also Tangale Traditional Council V. Fawu (2001) 17 NWLR (Pt. 742) 330 @ pp. 335 - 336.\\n\\nIt is now elementary that evaluation of evidence would entail and demand that the evidence proffered by the parties are assessed, appraised and weighed impartially on the imaginary scale of justice by the Court so as to give probative value or quality to it and there must be on the record, and very importantly too, how the Court arrived at its choice of preference of one piece of evidence to the other. It cannot just be merely a product of the whims and caprices of the judge. No! He must show on record his reason for so doing. See Alake V. State (1992) 9 NWLR (Pt. 265) 260.

Ltd (2014) LPELR - 22583 (CA).\\n\\nThe 1st Respondent as Claimant before the Court below testified for himself and stated inter alia that he acquired his title from one Ibhafidon Aburimen vide a Deed of Conveyance executed on 26/6/1972, and that his own predecessor in title, Mr. Ibhafidon Aburimen acquired his title from His Royal Highness, Oba Akenzua II, the Oba of Benin by way of Conveyance into which an Oba's approval dated 8/12/1070 was attached and that both his predecessor\\u2019 title and his title were duly registered at the Land Registry, Benin. He also testified that he had been in undisturbed possession of the land in dispute and had over the years exercised several acts of ownership, including selling portion of his larger land to various purchasers without any let or hindrance. He tendered several documents which were admitted as Exhibits. He also called his Surveyor who testified as PW2.\\n\\n\\u200bOn their part, the 2nd Appellant testified on behalf of the Appellants and stated inter alia that they bought the land in dispute from their Predecessor in title, one Ugiabge\\n56\\n Omoragbon, who is a beneficiary of a grant of the land in dispute to him by the Oba of Benin and the Oba\\u2019s approval was dated 10/1/1970 based on an application made to the Oba of Benin on 15/12/1969. Upon their taking possession they met with some persons claiming to be purchasers of some of the portions of land purchased by them and had to enter into settlement with them and re - purchased the lands from them, including the land in dispute which in addition to their having validly bought same from their Vendor they had to re-purchase from the 2nd Respondent acting on behalf of his Sister one Miss Iriagbonse Okeaya - Inneh, to whom it was alleged that the 1st Respondent had assigned the land in dispute to but maintained that they had already validly purchased the land in dispute from their predecessor in title, Ugiagbe Omoragbon. They called two witnesses, one of which was their Surveyor. \\n\\nIt was on the strength of the pleadings and evidence of the parties led through themselves and their witnesses as in the Record of appeal, that the Court below had on 14/4/2011 delivered its judgment in which it granted the claims of the 1st Respondent against\\n\\n57\\n the Appellants, stating and holding inter alia thus: \\n\\u201c\\u2026\\u2026The Plaintiff's version of how he acquired title to the land is backed up by valid documents which were authentic and verifiable\\u2026right from the radical title of the Plaintiff's predecessor in title\\u2026Deed of Conveyance and the Oba's approval\\u2026.were duly registered at the Lands Registry, Benin City\\u2026.the Plaintiff\\u2019s Deed of conveyance dated 26/1972\\u2026was also registered at the Lands Registry, Benin City\\u2026.Thereby constituting a Notice to the whole world that the Plaintiff is indeed the legal owner of the piece or parcel of land part of which is now in dispute\\u2026The question then is, if indeed, Pa. Ugiagbe Omoragbon the Defendants' predecessor in title had already acquired title to the piece or parcel of land now in dispute as at 1970 when Exhibit A was signed\\u2026.he did not raise objection to the alleged subsequent conveyance of the same piece or parcel of land to Ibhafidon Aburimen by the Oba of Benin\\u2026? The only logical answer \\u2026is that there was no protest or objection from Pa. Ugiagbe because he did not own or have\\n\\n58\\n title to any piece of land in the area. The 1st and 2nd Defendants case on the other hand relies on an Oba's approval in the name of their predecessor in title\\u2026.and the Deed of transfer\\u2026The said Oba's approval\\u2026.is not registered at the Lands Registry\\u2026It is therefore my conclusion on this point that the Oba's approval and the Deed of transfer entered into by the 1st and 2nd Defendant coupled with the payment of the purchase price by the 1st and 2nd Defendants conferred only an equitable interest on them. Meanwhile, the Plaintiff's predecessor in title had earlier acquired legal title to the said piece of land by his Oba's approval and Conveyance dated in 1970\\u2026.The 1st and 2nd Defendants did not conduct any investigation of the title to the land before they proceeded to purchase same from Omoragbon Ugiagbe in 1992. For had they done so they would have discovered that the legal interest to the aforesaid piece or parcel of land had since been acquired by the Plaintiff and duly registered at the Lands Registry at Benin City\\u2026Thus, the 1st and 2nd Defendants cannot even claim the right of a bonafide purchaser for value without\\n\\n59\\n notice\\u2026.I therefore hold on this point that the Plaintiff has succeeded in proving good title to the land in dispute\\u2026. The 1st and 2nd Defendants bought nothing from the said Omoragbon Ugiagbe because at the time of the said transaction, the legal interest on the land in dispute was already vested in the Plaintiff\\u2026The transactions between the 1st and 2nd Defendants and the said Omoragbori Ugiagbe was therefore a nullity...\\u201d See pages 111 - 189 of the Record of Appeal. \\n\\nMy lords, it has been contended for the 1st Respondent that the issue of the exact size and dimension of the land in dispute as raised under issue two in this appeal is a fresh issue. What then is a fresh issue in law? In law, a fresh issue for which prior leave of Court is required to be valid is one which was not canvassed at the Court below and was therefore, not pronounced upon by the Court below. It is not one which though duly raised and issues joined and evidence led thereon but a trial Court fails or refuses or neglects to consider and determine it. Thus, it is not every issue which a trial Court did not pronounce upon that would automatically amount to a\\n\\n60\\n fresh issue. In law, once an issue was duly raised but was not considered and determined by the trial Court, it would not ipso facto amount to a fresh issue simply because the trial Court had failed to consider and resolve it. It is only where an issue was not raised before the trial Court but is being raised for the first time on appeal, without first seeking and obtaining the leave of Court, that such an issue would be considered invalid by this Court since this Court would then lack the jurisdiction to entertain any such fresh issue. To consider a fresh issue without leave would clearly be tantamount to ambushing the adverse party and which will undoubtedly contravene the inalienable right of the adverse party to fair hearing as guaranteed to him under Section 36(1) of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). See Donald V. Saleh (2015) 2 NWLR (Pt. 1444) 529 @ p. 566. See also Olalomi Ind. Ltd. v. N.I.D.B. Ltd. (2009) 16 NWLR (Pt. 1167) 266 @ p. 286. \\n\\nNow, there were copious joinder of issues and copious evidence led by the parties through their respective witnesses and Survey plans tendered before the Court below as to the size and dimension of\\n\\n61\\n the land being claimed by the 1st Respondent against the Appellants. So serious was this issue that both parties ferociously cross - examined the Surveyor to the other party and one evidence on which both Surveyors were concurrent and ad idem was that the part of the land being claimed by the 1st Respondent was clearly outside Plot 35 in Exhibit G as well as in the composite plan Exhibit O. So, how can it then be argued that the issue of the differences in the size and dimension of the land as claimed by the 1st Respondent and as shown in his own land in dispute litigation survey plan Exhibit G was not in issue? In my finding it was in issue and the Court below was under a duty to consider and resolve it but which it failed woefully to do as was even conceded to by the 1st Respondent. \\n\\n\\u200bIn law, the first duty on a party claiming declaration of title to land is to prove with exactitude the location, description, size, dimension and features of the land he claims both a declaration of title to land, damages for trespass, and perpetual injunction, and if he fails to discharge this duty, then his entire claim must fail. He is only relieved of this duty where the\\n\\n62\\n identity, size and dimension of the land in dispute which he claims is not put in issue by the adverse party. This is so because without the exact identity of the land in dispute over which a declaration of title is sought, there cannot be any declaration of title to an undetermined and indeterminate piece of land by the Court. The identity of the land in dispute is therefore&nbsp;sacrosanct and must be proved unless it is not put in issue. See&nbsp;Atanda V. Iliasu (2013) 18 WRN 1. See also Onwuka V. Ediala (1989) 1 NWLR (Pt. 96) 182. See also Makanjuola V. Balogun (1989) 3 NWLR (Pt. 108) 122; Echenim Ofume V. Isaac Ngbeke (1994) 4 NWLR (Pt. 341) 746; Olosunde V. Oladele (1991) 4 NWLR (Pt. 188) 113.\\n\\n\\u200bHaving resolved that issue two is not a fresh issue and therefore, no leave of Court was required, let me now consider issues one and two together and resolve them in one fell swoop. In addition to the oral evidence led the parties they also relied copiously on documentary evidence as in the Record of Appeal. I have taken time to review the pleadings of the parties and dispassionately evaluated the entirety of the evidence, both oral and documentary as led by the\\n\\n63\\n parties in the light of the findings and conclusion reached thereon by the Court below in holding that the 1st Respondent proved a better title to the land in dispute and was therefore&nbsp;entitled to the declaration of title to the land in dispute as against the Appellants. Let me now use the copious documentary Exhibits as hangers to access the veracity of the oral evidence as led by the parties and see whether or not the findings and conclusions reached by the Court below, and complained of in this appeal, do flow from the evidence as led by the parties and were thus correct, sound and unimpeachable in this appeal. \\n\\nIn Exhibit A, an indenture in which the 1st Respondent\\u2019s predecessor in title, one Ibhafidon Aburime, was granted by His Highness Oba Akenzua II the Oba of Benin some parcel of land on 3/2/1972, in the recital it is stated inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cWhereas... 2. By an application dated the 31/10/1970 the Grantee applied to the Grantor for a grant of the said piece or parcel of land; 3. The said application was granted on the 8/12/1970.\\u201d\\n\\nIn Exhibit B, an indenture in which the 1st Respondent\\u2019s predecessor in title\\n\\n64\\n conveyed some parcels of land to the 1st Respondent on 26/6/1972 in respect of the land earlier granted to the 1st Respondent\\u2019s predecessor by the Oba of Benin as in Exhibit A. In Exhibit F, the 1st Respondent plot layout showing Plots 32, 33, 34 and 35, which is the plot in dispute. In Exhibit G, the 1st Respondent\\u2019s amended Survey Plan of the land dispute, in which it is shown clearly that part of Plot 35 is outside the land of the 1st Respondent and was made by the 1st Respondent\\u2019s own Surveyor, one Surv. F. U. Iyawe and dated 28/3/2002. In Exhibit O, the Appellants\\u2019 Land in dispute Survey Plan, in which it is shown clearly that part of the land in dispute is outside the 1st Respondent\\u2019s land but including the 1st Respondent\\u2019s Plots 32, 33, 34 and part of Plot 35. It was made by the Appellants\\u2019 Surveyor, one Surv. Osaikhunwu and dated 2/7/2001. In Exhibit Q, the Appellants\\u2019 predecessor in title\\u2019s application for approval by Oba of Benin dated 15/12/1969 and which was approved by the Oba of Benin on 10/1/1970. In Exhibit R, the 1st Appellant\\u2019s Deed of Transfer dated 22/12/1977 from his Vendor together\\n\\n65\\n with the Oba approval granted on 10/1/1970.\\n\\nNow, going by Exhibits G and O, coupled with the admission under cross\\u2013examination by the respective Surveyors to the 1st Respondent and the Appellants it is clear and I so find as fact, contrary to the perverse finding by the Court below that the land in dispute is covered in its entirety by Plot 35, that some part of the land in dispute is clearly outside Plot 35 claimed by the 1st Respondent. It is clear on the pleadings that both parties relied on Oba\\u2019s approval and indenture from the Oba of Benin as the respective root of title of their predecessors in title to the land in dispute. \\n\\n\\u200bHowever, there is clear, unchallenged and uncontroverted evidence vide Exhibits A and R, that the root of title of the Appellants vide Oba\\u2019s approval in favor of their predecessor in title was made on 10/1/1970, while the root of title of the 1st Respondent vide Oba\\u2019s approval in favor of his predecessor in title was made on 8/12/1970. It follows therefore, and I so find as fact that the Oba\\u2019s approval of the Appellants\\u2019 predecessor in title, that is their root of title to the land in\\n\\n66\\n dispute, is prior to and therefore, predates the 1st Respondent\\u2019s predecessor\\u2019s Oba approval, that is his root of title. The parties are ad idem and the evidence on it are unchallenged that both Oba\\u2019s approval relates to the same land in dispute. \\n\\nThus, as at 3/2/1972 when Exhibit A was executed between His Highness Oba Akenzua II as Grantor and Ibhafidon Aburime as Grantee, the Vendor/predecessor in title to the 1st Respondent, based on the Oba\\u2019s approval made on 8/12/1970, on the face of the earlier Oba\\u2019s approval made on 10/1/1970 in favor of Ugiagbe Omoragbon, the Vendor to the Appellants, as in Exhibit Q, there was no proprietary interest or right left in the Oba of Benin in the land in dispute to grant or approve or convey to the Vendor to the 1st Respondent in the absence of any evidence of cancellation of the earlier Oba\\u2019s approval made on 10/1/1970 in favor of the Vendor/Predecessor in title to the Appellants. \\n\\n\\u200bIn law therefore, as at 26/6/1972 when the 1st Respondent purported to buy the land in dispute as part of the land conveyed to him by his Vendor one Ibhafidon Aburime, his Vendor had nothing to\\n\\n67\\n convey unto the 1st Respondent. The law is \\u2018nemo dat quod non habet\\u2019, meaning one cannot give out what one does not have. See Amuda V. Ajobo (1995) 7 NWLR (Pt. 406) 170 @ p. 182, where it was stated inter alia thus:\\n\\\"The position is that the Defendant sued by the Plaintiff had no interest in the land subject matter of the dispute. Having sold the land to architect Adedeji as pleaded by the Defendant and given in evidence by the 1st Defendant, the Defendant has no interest whatsoever in the land in dispute to protect or defend\\u2026Consequently, her counter claim fails in its entirety and is hereby dismissed.\\\"\\n\\nMy lords, the law is and has always been that mere production of title documents, such as Exhibits A and B alone by the 1st Respondent did not ground any valid title to the land in dispute in that&nbsp;such a document of title to ground title to land must be a valid document capable of passing title to the party relying on it.&nbsp;It is also the law that registration of title document alone does not ipso facto cure a defective root of title.It is agreed by both parties, and it had been judicially noticed and accepted as true that under\\n\\n68\\n the Native and Custom in relation to land as obtainable in the Benin Kingdom, at least before the promulgation of the Land Use Act in 1978, all lands are vested in the Oba of Benin, who is the overlord of all lands. Thus, a grant of land by the Oba of Benin based on the Oba\\u2019s approval of such a grant of land to a grantee was by itself valid and is neither subject to nor requires registration at the Lands Registry Benin City to be valid. See&nbsp;Amayo V. Erinmwingbovo (2006) 11 NWLR (Pt. 992) 669 @ p. 682, where the Supreme Court per Katsina - Alu, JSC (as he then was but later CJN) had stated inter alia thus: \\n\\u201cLand in Benin is vested in the Oba of Benin under Customary Law\\u201d. \\nSee also Atiti Gold V. Beatrice Osaseren (1970) 1 All NLR 125.\\nIt would appear that registration of title document strictu senso was unknown to the Benin Customary land tenure system before 1978. In other words, the validity of a grant made by the Oba of Benin based on the Oba\\u2019s approval is final and does not become invalid merely for lack of registration, at least before the coming into force of the Land Use Act 1978 as in the instant appeal involving\\n\\n69\\n grant by the Oba of Benin and Oba\\u2019s approval made in 1970, long before the promulgation of the Land Use Act in 1978. In the circumstances therefore, it is my view and I so hold, that the Court below clearly misapprehended and misdirected itself on the onus of proof and arrived at very perverse findings and conclusions in its judgment, even running contrary to the case as pleaded and presented before it by the 1st Respondent, whose witness PW1 affirmed that part of the land in dispute was clearly outside the land being claimed by the 1st Respondent as in Exhibit G, while the Court below, without any supporting evidence, found on the contrary that the entire land in dispute was within the land claimed by the 1st Respondent. \\n\\nI have considered the contention of the learned counsel for the 1st Respondent on the effect of the submission to settlement by the Appellants with the 2nd Respondent acting on behalf of Miss Eregbonse Okeaya-Inneh. There is an agreement dated 9/4/1993 and tendered in evidence as Exhibit S.

This Honourable Court in appeal No. CA/K/201/2008 allowed the appeal in a judgment delivered on 15th December, 2010, on the ground that the Federal High Court, Katsina, lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action; hence the judgment was set aside and the suit struck out. Consequently, the Respondent filed a fresh action before the High Court of Katsina State in Suit No: KTH/FT/135M/2010 against Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye (Receiver/Manager Stirling Civil Engineering Nig. Ltd.) under the undefended list procedure claiming Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and Sixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50K) being the balance payment due to the Plaintiff for carrying out sub-contract work of stone\\n2\\n pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Ltd.\\n\\nThe Respondent applied at the trial Court for the matter to be placed on the Undefended List pursuant to Order 22 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules Cap 60 Laws of Katsina State, 1991 and being satisfied that the requirements of the Rules of Court had been met, the Court granted the application. Furthermore, the Respondent obtained the leave of Court to serve the originating processes on the Appellant outside jurisdiction and the bailiff of the trial Court served the writ of summons and accompanying affidavit with the order of the Court granting leave to serve outside jurisdiction (which was obtained ex parte) on the Appellant's secretary, one Miss Ebere Nge of Babington Ashaye &amp; Co. The bailiff of the trial Court filed a proof of service of the originating processes on the Appellant and also delivered the processes to the Appellant's Counsel at his chambers but no step was taken to file any notice of intention to defend the action. On 14th February, 2011, when the matter came up for hearing, the Appellant was absent and unrepresented by\\n\\n3\\n Counsel. No notice of intention to defend the action was filed by the Appellant. However, during the course of the proceedings, just when the Court was about pronouncing its judgment, counsel to the Appellant, Mr. O.A. Orewale Esq. arrived in Court very late and the judge refused to record the counsel's appearance. Upon a careful consideration of the Writ, the affidavit in support and Exhibits 1- 13 annexed and the oral submissions of Counsel to the Respondent, the trial Court proceeded to enter judgment in favour of the Respondent for the sum of Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and Sixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50k) together with interest at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid. Sequel to the decision of the trial Court, the Appellant as judgment debtor filed a motion dated 14th February, 2011, at the trial Court praying the Court to set aside its judgment, which the Respondent's Counsel vehemently opposed in a counter affidavit among other issues that the Court had become functus officio and should dismiss the application. After a careful consideration, the trial Court dismissed the application for\\n\\n4\\n lacking in merit. While the appeal was pending, the initial Appellant, Mr. Babington Ashaye died and the Appellant's Counsel filed an application dated 8th February, 2013, praying for leave to substitute Mr. Babington Ashaye with Mr. Babatunde Ajayi, who is the new Receiver of Stirling Civil Engineering Ltd. The application was granted by this Honourable Court on the 18th of June, 2013, and the notice of appeal was amended and filed accordingly.\\n\\nDissatisfied with the said judgment, the Appellant appealed vide an amended Notice of Appeal dated and filed 27/6/2013, wherein 5 Grounds of Appeal were raised as herein under reproduced without their particulars:\\nGROUNDS OF APPEAL:\\nGROUND ONE:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he assumed jurisdiction over the matter and proceeded to enter judgment in the sum of N22,466,200.50 under undefended list against the Appellant when the Appellant was not a proper party to the suit.\\nGROUND TWO:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he assumed jurisdiction over the matter and proceeded to enter judgment in the sum of N22,466/200.50 (Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and\\n\\n5\\nSixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo) under undefended list against the Appellant when the Respondent's action was statute Barred.\\nGROUND THREE:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he entered judgment against the Appellant for the sum of N22,466,200.50 under the undefended list in violation of the Appellant's constitutional right to fair hearing enshrined in Section 36(1) of 1999 Constitution.\\nGROUND FOUR:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when without jurisdiction he proceeded to (sic) the Respondent's suit and entered judgment against the Appellant for the sum of N22.466.200.50 on 14th February 2011.\\nGROUND FIVE:\\nThe learned trial judge erred in law when he assumed jurisdiction over the Respondent's suit and proceeded to enter judgment under undefended list against the Appellant for the sum of N22,466,200.50 on 14th February 2011 when the Respondent had not complied with condition precedent for the learned trial judge to exercise jurisdiction over the Respondent's suit.\\n\\nIn accordance with the Rules of this Court, the Appellant filed his Brief of Argument dated 12/12/2013 but\\n6\\n deemed properly filed on 1/12/2014, and a Reply brief dated 23/12/2015; settled by Lawrence Fubara Anga, Esq, wherein he formulated 4 issues for the determination of the appeal to wit:\\n1. Whether the Defendant, Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye, was a proper party at the lower Court having been sued as Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye (Receiver, Stirling civil Engineering Nigeria Limited in Receivership) so as to cloth the lower Court with jurisdiction to enter judgment for the sum of N22.466,200.50 against him? \\n(Distilled from Ground one of the Grounds of Appeal).\\n2. Whether the Respondent's action at the lower Court was not statute barred having been instituted six years after the cause of action arose? (Distilled from Ground Two).\\n3. Whether the non-service on the Appellant of the affidavit in support of the writ of summons as required by Order 22 Rules 1 and 2 of the High court of Katsina State (Civil Procedure) Rules 1991 before the lower Court entered judgment for the sum of N22,466,200.50 against the Appellant was not a violation of the Appellant's constitutional right to fair hearing enshrined in Section 36(1) of the 1999 Constitution?&nbsp;(Distilled from Ground Three).\\n\\n7\\n4. Whether the learned trial judge properly exercised its jurisdiction in entering judgment for the sum of N22,466,200.50 against the Appellant when the Appellant was not served personally with the originating processes as required by the Rules of the lower Court? (Distilled from Ground Four).\\n\\nThe Respondent filed his brief dated 19/3/2015 but deemed properly filed on 9/11/2015; settled by L.E. Oga, ESq., wherein he adopted issue 1 formulated by the Appellant's Counsel and formulated additional 3 issues for the determination of this appeal as follows: \\n1. Whether the Defendant, Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye, was a proper party at the lower Court having been sued as Mr. Ade A.&nbsp;Babington Ashaye (Receiver, Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Limited in Receivership) so as to cloth the lower Court with jurisdiction to enter judgment for the sum of N22.466.200.50 against him? (Distilled from Ground one of the Notice of Appeal).\\n2. Whether the Respondent's action at the lower Court was not statute barred? (Distilled from Ground Two of the Notice of Appeal).\\n3. Whether the Appellant who was\\n\\n8\\n duly served with Court processes and did not swear to any affidavit of rebuttal (challenging the affidavit deposed to by the Court's bailiff) can argue on appeal that the processes served were incomplete or that his constitutional right to fair hearing was denied? (Distilled from Ground three of the Notice of Appeal).\\n4. When a person is sued as a Receiver of a limited liability company under Receivership, is he acting in persona meaning that he must be served with processes personally or is he acting as an embodiment of the company under Receivership meaning that he must be served as a company under the Companies and Allied Matters Act. In other words must service of processes be personally effected on a Receiver?\\n\\nAt the hearing of the appeal on 6/6/2016, the learned Counsel to the Appellant adopted his Brief of argument and its Reply and prayed this Court to allow the appeal while the learned Counsel to the Respondent adopted his Brief and urged the Court to dismiss the appeal.\\n\\nSince the Appellant's issues challenge the jurisdiction of the trial Court, I shall formulate an issue for the determination of this appeal thus:\\n\\n9\\nWhether the trial Court had jurisdiction to entertain the suit of the Respondent and enter judgment as it did.\\n\\nIt is contended by the learned Counsel to the Appellant that though Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye was the Receiver/Manager of Stirling Civil Eng. (Nig.) Ltd, a Receiver cannot sue or be sued in his own name as receiver since he has no property vested in him, and so acquires no right of action by his appointment. This applies where he is being sued. Thus, that a plaintiff who wants to sue a receiver must sue in the name and on behalf of the company over which he was appointed a receiver. He relied on ATKIN's COURT FORMS VOL.33, S. 393(3) CAMA, 2004 and RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 481 AT 489 H. That the suit against the Appellant ought to have been commenced against the proper party, the trial Court was in error to enter judgment against the Appellant. He relied on SOFOLAHAN v. FOWLER (2002) 14 NWLR (Pt.788) 664. He submitted that the action ought to have been brought against Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its Receiver/Manager Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye).\\n\\nOn the action of the Respondent being caught up\\n\\n10\\n by the statute of limitation, it is submitted by the learned Counsel to the Appellant that by the Writ of Summons and the depositions of the Respondent, the cause of action in the instant appeal arose on 17/11/1999, whereas the suit was instituted in 2010. Thus, cause of action accrues from the date which the incident that gave rise to the cause of action accrued. In support, he cited CHEVRON (NIG) LTD. v L.D. (NIG) LTD. (2007) 16 NWLR (PT.1059) 168 AT 192-3, EGBE V. ADEFARASIN (1985) 1 NWLR (PT.3) 549, IBEKWE V I.S.E.M.B. (2009) 5 NWLR (PT.1134) 234 AT 257, HUMBE V A.G. BENUE STATE (2000) 3 NWLR (PT.649) 419 AT 433 PARA D. That being an action for recovery of debt, the period of limitation is 6 years and any action instituted after that is statute barred. He cited N.S.T.F.M.B. v. KLIFCO NIG. LTD. (2010) 13 NWLR (PT.1211) 307 AT 329, OGOJA LOCAL GOVERNMENT V OFFOBOCHE (1996) 7 NWLR (PT. 458) 48 AT 92 PARAS G-H, IBEKWE V I.S.E.M.B (2009) 5 NWLR (PT.1134) 234 AT 257, EGBE V ADEFARASIN (1987) 1 NWLR (PT.47) 1 AT 20. He submitted that a statute of limitation removes the right of action. He quoted in support IBRAHIM v. JSC (1998) 14 NWLR (PT. 584) 1 AT 31-32, AREMO    11\\n II V ADEKANYE (2000) 2 NWLR (PT.644) 257 AT 271.\\n\\nOn the non-service on the Appellant of the affidavit in support of the writ, the Counsel to the Appellant contended that it is a violation of the Appellant's right to fair hearing. It is submitted that by Order 22 Rules 1 and 2 of the High Court of Katsina State (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1991, the mode and manner of commencing action under the undefended list is prescribed. Thus, the writ of summons and the affidavit must be served on the Defendant. The object of the affidavit is to give understanding to the Defendant of the case against him. He relied on OTOBAIMERE v. AKPOREHE (2004) 14 NWLR (PT. 894) 591 AT 611 PARAGRAPHS A-B. That as can be gleaned from the writ issued the Appellant, there was no affidavit annexed thereto as required by the said Order, hence it is manifest that there was no proof of service on the Appellant before judgment was entered against the Appellant on 14/2/2011. He submitted that this fact was never contradicted and are deemed admitted. He relied on UZODINMA v. IZUNASO (2011) 17 NWLR (PT.1275) 30 AT 56 PARAGRAPH F-G. Therefore, that non-service of the writ with the affidavit is\\n\\n12\\na violation of the twin pillars of fair hearing which is protected by the Constitution and any breach is a nullity. He cited&nbsp;J.O.E. CO. LTD. v. SKYE BANK PLC (2009) 6 NWLR (PT. 1138) 518 AT 540, DINGYADI V INEC (NO.1) (2010) 18 NWLR (PT. 1224) 1 AT 90, RASAKI SALU V TAIWO EGEIBON (1994) 6 NWLR (PT. 348) 23 AT 44.\\n\\nFurthermore, that the trial Court did not properly exercise jurisdiction when the Appellant was not personally served with the originating processes. That by Order 12 Rule 2 and 3(1), personal service must be effected. He relied on ONONYE V. CHUKWUMA (2005) 17 NWLR (PT.955) 90 AT 114 G-H. Thus, that where there is no personal service, the jurisdiction of the Court is not properly invoked. He relied on MARK v. EKE (2004) 5 NWLR (PT.865) 54 AT 79, MIDEN SYSTEM LTD. V EFFIONG (2011) 2 NWLR (PT. 1231) 354 AT 366. That there was no proof of service on Mr Ade A. Babington Ashaye. That service on the Secretary (Ebere Nge) in the Firm of Mr Ade A. Babington Ashaye, cannot be said to be proper and personal service. He relied in support on the case of MIDEN SYSTEM LTD. v. EFFIONG (2011) 2 NWLR (pr. 1231) 354. Therefore, that non-compliance with due\\n13\\n process of law relating to the service of originating process, which are pre-conditions for the exercise of the Court's jurisdiction have not been met. He cited MANAGEMENT ENTERPRISES &amp; ANOR. V. OTUSANYA (1987) 2 NWLR (PT.55) 179. He urged this Court to resolve this issue in his favour, allow the appeal and set aside the lower Court's judgment.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the learned counsel to the Respondent submitted that there is no dispute that the Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd is in receivership and Mr Ade A. Babington Ashaye was the Receiver/Manager of Stirling civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. He distinguished this case with the one in RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 481 AT 489 H and that the Receiver/Manager in this case is a competent one duly appointed and was sued because of his refusal to pay up the debt owed to the Respondent and the same Receiver placed an advert in the Newspaper. Hence, he held himself out as the person responsible for the liabilities of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. Thus, that contracts entered into by a company before the appointment of a Receiver/Manager are binding on the Receiver. He relied on TANAREWA (NIG) LTD. V    14\\n PLASTIFARM LTD. (2003) 14 NWLR (PT.840) 355 AT 379-380 PARAS. B-A, BABINGTON-ASHAYE V E.M.A. GEN. ENT. (NIG) LTD. (2012) ALL FWLR (PT.655 PG. 256 AT 282 PARA. H. Again, that if the Appellant maintains that he ought not to have been sued in that manner, then his appeal is incompetent.\\n\\nOn the purpose of statute of limitation, time begins to run from the date on which the cause of action accrues and the period of limitation is determined by looking at the writ of summons and the statement of claim. He relied&nbsp;EBOIGBE v. NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (1994) 5 NWLR (PT.347) 649, NDUKA V. OGBONNA (2011) 1 NWLR (PT.1227) 153 AT 168. It is submitted that by the deposition and exhibits of the Respondent, cause of action was renewed by the admission of the debt by Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd and where there is such admission, cause of action cannot be barred. He cited S.P.D.C.N. v. EJEBU (2011) 17 NWLR (PT. 1276) PG. 324 AT 342 PARAS. D-E. Also that the Respondent did not go to sleep as they immediately filed this case 5 days after the striking out of the first case.\\n\\nIt is submitted that the Appellant was duly served with the accompanying\\n\\n15\\n affidavit to the writ as shown by the records and where this is not the case; the party contesting ought to swear to an affidavit of rebuttal. He relied on AINA V. OBAIOLORUNKOSI (1986) 2 NWLR (PT.22) PAGE 316 AT 322 PARAS C-G.&nbsp;On breach of fair hearing, it is submitted that a party who refuses to take advantage of the fair hearing process cannot turn around and accuse the Court of denying him fair hearing. It is contended that the Appellant was aware of the case against him, yet did not file a conditional appearance to challenge the writ nor did he file a notice of intention to defend the suit. He cited&nbsp;DANTATA V MOHAMMED (2012) 8 NWLR (pt. 1302) PAGE 366 AT 381 PARAS. A-C. Assuming but not conceding that there was no accompanying affidavit, it is a mistake of the bailiff and cannot vitiate the proceedings of the lower Court. He relied on FAMFA OIL LTD v. A.G FED (2003) 18 NWLR (PT.852) 453 AT 471 PARAS F-G. Learned Counsel has submitted that the Appellant had admitted in paragraph 4 of his further affidavit to his motion dated 14/4/2011 that the Appellant was served with all the processes. Also, that there is presumption of regularity in favour of the\\n\\n16\\n Respondent pursuant to Section 168 (1) of the Evidence Act, 2011 and NADABO v. DUBAI (2011) 7 NWLR (Pt.1245) PG. 155 AT 179 PARAS. E-F.\\n\\nOn the illegality of service on the Appellant, it is submitted that service was not done in the Appellant in his personal capacity as Mr Babington-Ashaye but in his capacity as Receiver to the corporate entity known as Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. That within the period a company is in receivership, the Receiver is the one in charge of the company. He cited DAGAZAU v. BOKIR INTERNATIONAL CO. LTD. (2011) 14 NWLR (PT. 1267) PG. 261 AT 325. He maintained that service on a company is different from service on a corporate body. He in support relied on CASH AFFAIRS FINANCE LTD. V INLAND BANK (NIG) PLC (2000) 1 NWLR (PT.658) PG. 685. Again, that the Appellant had the opportunity to have objected to this at the trial stage. He cited the Supreme Court authority in EZOMO v. OYAKHIRE (1985) 1 NWLR (PT.2) PG. 195 AT 201-203. Similarly, that defect in service is a mere irregularity. He relied on ADEGOKE MOTORS v. ADESANYA (1989) 3 NWLR (PT.109) 250 AT 265, PARAS B-C. He prayed this Court to dismiss the appeal and uphold the\\n\\n17\\n decision of the Katsina State High Court, Funtua.\\n\\nA Reply Brief is not for a second bite at the cherry. Indeed, I see no new issues in the argument of the Respondent that should necessitate a Reply from the Appellant's learned Counsel. A Reply brief is not for re-argument, rejoinder or adumbration of issues but for addressing new issues raised in the Respondent's brief, if any. See RAYMOND D. OGOLO V PAUL D. FUBARA (2003) 5 SC 141 AT 156, (2003) FWLR (PT.169) 1285 AT 1308 SC, NITEL PLC V OCHOLI (2001) FWLR (PT.74) 254 AT 267. Therefore, there is no merit to consider the Reply brief of the Appellant.\\n\\nAs a general rule, a Receiver cannot sue or be sued in his own name as receiver since he has no property vested in him, and so acquires no right of action by his appointment. See RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 481 AT 489 H. It is in this instance that the Receiver ought not to sue in his own name but against \\\"Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its Receiver/Manager Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye)\\\". However, general laws have never been without exceptions. This was stated in the case of RE: ADETONA (1994) 3 NWLR (PT. 333) 491\\n\\n18\\n AT 490 PARA C, when it was held thus:\\n\\\"As a general rule a receiver as such, is not entitled to bring an action in his own name as receiver. This is because no property is automatically vested in him by his appointment. But he may acquire a right to sue in his own name arising out of his receivership, but not in consequence of it alone.\\\"\\nIn the present appeal however, it is notable that the property was vested in the Receiver who was sued because he refused to pay up the debt owed to the Respondent by Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. It was the Receiver who was vested with the right over the property to advertise same in Guardian Newspaper of 21/2/2005, hence holding himself out as the person responsible for discharging the liabilities of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. Appurtenant to this was the decision of this Court per PEMU, J.C.A. in FREDRIKO V PETROLEUM SERVICES COMPANY LTD v. FBN PLC &amp; ANOR (2014) LPELR-22538(CA), wherein it held:\\n\\\"No company has any locus standi to sue where it has already entered receivership. It is the Receiver/Manager, who, by operation of law, should sue on behalf of the Company. Indeed the powers of\\n\\n19\\n the Directors of the Company became paralyzed because of the appointment of the Receiver/Manager. The Assets of the Company remain with the Receiver/Manager and he alone has the right to deal with these assets as long as he remains the Receiver Manager. The rights to deal with the assets inherent in the receivership can only be revived at the end and/or termination of the Receivership.\\\"\\nIn the same light, it is on record that the Appellant held out MR BABATUNDE AJAYI or as he was MR ADE A. BABINGTON-ASHAYE as the Agent and Receiver of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. when it variously responded&nbsp;to the suits and application of the Respondent without protest to the fact that the suit ought to have been instituted against \\\"Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its Receiver/Manager Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye)\\\" and not the other way round. At pages 55- 59 of the records, when the Appellant filed its motion on notice wherein it sought that the judgment of the trial Court be set aside, it never out of the 9 Grounds objected or protested that the suit ought to have been instituted against \\\"Stirling Engineering Nigeria Limited (sued by its\\n\\n20\\n Receiver/Manager MR ADE A. BABINGTON-ASHAYE)\\\" save that it protested under Ground 4 that the leave of the trial Court was not obtained to institute the action against the defendant as the Receiver/Manager of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. Again, in its Further Affidavit at pages 115-116, no such protest was made. It is also on record that the Appellant after the demise of MR ADE A. BABINGTON ASHAYE and during the pendency of this appeal applied and substituted same with MR BABATUNDE AJAYI/Receiver/Manager of Stirling Civil Engineering Nig. Ltd without any effort to have the proper Appellant or Defendant as it was before the Court. MR ADE A. BABINGTON-ASHAYE was then an agent of Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd for the purpose of liquidating the debts of the Respondent. Thus, the agent normally binds not himself but his principal by the contracts he makes. See GLOBAL SOAP AND DETERGENT IND. LTD. &amp; ORS. V BELLO &amp; ANOR. (2011) LPELR-9092(CA).\\n\\nSimilarly, where the mistake is as to name, the application can be brought to Court to amend by substituting the name with the one known in law. In such a case, it is only a misnomer which is the case in this\\n\\n21\\n appeal.&nbsp;Where therefore a party has been misjoined, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings order that the name of any party improperly joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, be struck out or amended. This is on the application of the party that is interested and is to be affected. The Appellant had this burden on him but failed woefully to do that only now to be crying foul. This is unacceptable in law. It has been held that no cause or matter shall be defeated by reason of the misjoinder or non-joinder of parties as the Court may in every cause or matter deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interest of the parties actually before it. See OSONDU v. SOLEL BONEH (NIG) LTD (2000) 3 SC 429 AT 461, BABAYEJU V ASHAMU (1998) 9 NWLR (PT.567) 546. Where there is no complaint against a party, the non-joinder of that party will not affect the proper determination of the issues joined. See DANTSOHO v. MOHAMMED (2003) 2 SC 42 AT 55.\\n\\nIt is foremost to note that in determining the limitation period, it is advisable to look at the processes filed by the Claimant herein the Respondent. See MIL. ADMIN., EKITI STATE v. ALADEYELU\\n\\n22\\n (2007) 14 NWLR (PT.1055) 619, WOHEREM V EMEREUWA (2004) 6-7 S.C. 161; (2004) 13 NWLR (PT. 890) 398 AT 417. By the pleadings of the Respondent particularly their affidavit in support dated 15/12/2010 and the annexures contained at pages 1-38, they asserted especially from paragraphs 16-21 that the Respondent's cause of action was renewed by the admission of the debt by Stirling Civil Eng. Nig. Ltd. The company equally did not contest the debt but wrote severally to confirm the balance from the Respondent as shown in the Exhibits at pages 31-33 of the records. Similarly, the company sent an undertaking to UBA Plc. to domicile payments for the subcontract.\\nUpon all the foregoing, the Appellant now wants to hide under the guise of statute of limitation to unscrupulously and unjustly enrich itself with the gain of N22,466,200.50 owed the Respondent which the company had blatantly refused to pay. In S.P.D.C.N v. EJEBU (2011) 17 NWLR (PT.1276) 324 AT 942 PARAS D-E, it was held thus: \\n\\\"It is also settled law that generally negotiation by the parties does not prevent or stop the period of limitation stipulated by a statute from running. This however is\\n\\n23\\n subject to qualification that where there has been admission of liability during negotiation and all that is remaining is fulfillment of the agreement it cannot be just and equitable that the action would be barred after the statutory period of limitation giving rise to the action if the defendant were to resile from the agreement during negotiation...From the following it is pre-supposed that \\n1. There was an admission of liability upon negotiation\\n2. Which produced an agreement binding on the parties, and not a mere offer,\\n3. And it will be inequitable for a party to be allowed to resile from the agreement reached during negotiation.\\\" \\nSee also NWADIARO v. SHELL PET. DEV. COY (1990) 5 NWLR (PT.150) 322 AT 338-339, SHELL PET. DEV. COY. V FARAH&nbsp;(1995) 3 NWLR (PT.382) 148 AT 156 RATIO 4. In OLAOGUN ENT. LTD V SAEBY JERNSTOBERI &amp; ANOR (1992) 4 NWLR (PT.235) 361, a case of claim of interest founded on contract which interest was said to be statute barred, it was held that an acknowledgement or promise to pay after limitation period must be very clear to raise any inference of acknowledgment or enforceable promise to pay the debt.\\n\\n24\\nBeing an action for recovery of debt, the period of limitation is 6 years and any action instituted after that is statute barred. See N.S.T.F.M.B. V KLIFCO NIG. LTD. (2010) 13 NWLR (PT.1211) 307 AT 329, OGOJA LOCAL GOVERNMENT V OFFOBOCHE (1996) 7 NWLR (PT. 458) 48 AT 92 PARAS G-H. Nevertheless, as deposed by the Respondent in paragraph 21 in the lower Court, the cause of action arose on 3/3/2005 whereas the case was instituted by the Respondent on 15/12/2010. Thus, its lifespan has not expired and is not caught up by the statute of limitation.\\n\\nOn the service of the writ on the Appellant without accompanying affidavit, the Appellant has submitted that it amounted to a breach of his right to fair hearing and therefore a nullity. It is not in dispute that the Appellant was not served a writ of summons but that it was not accompanied with an affidavit. In fact, there is proof or affidavit of service that the Appellant was so duly served. The object of a writ of summons was stated In SKENCONSULT (NIG.) LTD. &amp; ANOR. V UKEY (1981) 1 S.C. (REPRINT) 4, PER NNAMANI J.S.C. as follows:\\n\\\"Writ of summons includes any writ or process\\n\\n25\\n by which a suit is commenced or of which the object is to require the appearance of any person against whom relief is sought in a suit or who is interested in resisting such relief.\\\"\\nThe object of a writ is for the appearance of the other party who is \\\"commanded\\\" to enter a defence or appear. Furthermore, the relief sought by the Respondent was clearly written on the writ at page 43 of the records to include:\\ni. The sum of N22,466,200.50 (Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty Thousand, Two Hundred Naira, Fifty Kobo) being the balance payment due to the plaintiff for carrying out sub-contract work of stone-pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Sterling Civil Engineering Company Limited. \\nii. Interest on the above sum at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid. \\niii. Cost of action.\\nIn the light of the above, the Appellant who was commanded to enter his defence within 30 days or have judgment entered against him slept after clearly admitting at page 115 in paragraph 4 that he was served through Ebere Nge by one Abdullahi Tambai on 22/12/2010 and is on record that he was\\n\\n26\\n served, now turns around to complain that he was denied the right to fair hearing. Fair hearing implies hearing the parties or giving them the opportunity to be heard. See OKIKE v. LPDC &amp; ORS (2005) LPELR-7466(CA). In INEC v MUSA (2003) 3 NWLR (PT. 806) 72, the apex Court held that:\\n\\\"Fair hearing in essence means giving equal opportunity to the parties to be heard in the litigation before the Court where parties are given opportunity to be heard, they cannot complain of breach of fair hearing principles.\\\"\\nI think this is one of the most preposterous defence on fair hearing to be made. I cannot see where the non-accompaniment of affidavit can deny the Appellant the right to fair hearing. What strake of effort did he make to show the Court that the non-accompaniment of affidavit affected the service or amounted to non-service? If the Appellant was not duly served with the accompanying affidavit to the writ; the party contesting ought to swear to an affidavit of rebuttal. See AINA V.&nbsp;OBAIOLORUNKOSI (1936) 2 NWLR (PT.22) PAGE 316 AT 322 PARAS C-G.&nbsp;Does non-accompaniment of affidavit to writ of summons amount to non-service which robs the\\n\\n27\\nCourt its jurisdiction? Per GUMEL, J.C.A. in BELLO v. OHIKHUEME &amp; ORS (2014) LPELR-24412(CA) reasoned that the object of the service is to give notice to the defendant, so that he may be aware of, and be able to resist, if he may, that which is sought against him, because without that service, he may not know that the plaintiff has sued him before a particular Court. The Appellant has at most taken the order of Court on him for granted and has consequently waived every right available to him when he did not as commanded file any notice of intention to defend and allowed judgment to be entered against him for non-appearance according to the law. This Court has occasion to tersely state as follows Per PETER-ODILI, J.C.A in CBN V DINNEH (2005) LPELR-11849(CA):\\n\\\"Where limitation of action is related to torts and contract, it is an accepted principle that the statute of limitation is a defence which can be waived.\\\"\\n\\nCoupled with the issue that he was not personally served, there is already a presumption of service and regularity against the Appellant by his admission that \\\"I was informed by Ebere Nge on 15th February 2011 at\\n\\n28\\n 1:15pm in our office and I verily believe her that the bailiff of this Court namely Abdullahi Tambai on 22nd December 2010 served her with only writ without any accompanying affidavit...\\\" It was again conceded by the Appellant in paragraph 4.5 at page 6 of his brief that \\\"a receiver must be sued in the name and on behalf of the company.\\\" If that is the case as rightly submitted by the Appellant, why should he now expect personal service to be effected on him? It is the law that service on a company is on any director, secretary or other principal officer of the company. See Section 78 of CAMA, CASH AFFAIRS FINANCE LTD. v. INLAND BANK (NIG) PLC (2000) 1 NWLR (PT.658) 685. Indeed, the Appellant did not argue the fact that Ebere Nge is not the Secretary of the Appellant but did accept that she was.It is pertinent to note that this appeal arose from the judgment of the trial Court on the merit under the undefended list procedure delivered on 14/2/2011 which the trial Court considered at page 54 as follows:&nbsp;\\\"Now, considering the Writ the affidavit in support, Exhibits 1-13 annexed along with the oral submissions of Mr. Ogon of Counsel\\n\\n29\\n to the Plaintiff, I hereby enter judgment in favour of the Plaintiff for the sum of N22,406,200:50K.\\\"\\nHaving established that the Appellant was served, his failure to file notice of intention to defend cannot save his him. In A.S.T.C. V QUORUM CONSORTIUM (2009) 9 NWLR (PT. 1145) 1 S.C., the Supreme Court on this held Per MUKHTAR, J.S.C:\\n\\\"Having found, rightly in my view, that the appellants did not enter appearance and did not file notice of intention to defend the respondent's claim, I am satisfied that the trial judge was entitled to enter judgment... as he did.\\\"\\n\\nIn all therefore, I resolve this issue against the Appellant. The judgment of the High Court of Katsina State holden at Funtua in Suit No.KTH/FT/135M/10, delivered on 14/2/2011 by Hon. Justice I.M. Bako, is hereby affirmed. Consequently, the appeal fails and it is hereby dismissed.

(Delivering the Leading Judgment): This judgment is predicated on the appeal by Mr. Festus Utuama, herein referred to as the Appellant against the judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Warri in Suit No. FHC/WR/CS/53/2015 delivered on 5th April 2016, coram Hon. Justice E.A Obile wherein the Court struck out the suit of the Appellant after the adoption of final written addresses of the parties on both the preliminary objections by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the substantive suit.\\n\\nThe Appellant who was the plaintiff before the Lower Court filed an originating summons on 9th April, 2015 wherein he claimed against all the Respondents who are defendants before the Court as follows:\\n(1) Whether the National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is empowered to conduct primaries and present candidates to the Delta State House of Assembly election scheduled for April 11, 2015 on behalf of the party.\\n(2) Whether the plaintiff having won and was issued the certificate of return&nbsp;as the winner of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency1\\n primary election conducted by the National Working Committee of the 2nd defendant can be surreptitiously substituted with the 3rd defendant by the 1st and 2nd defendants as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency elections in total disregard of the report of the 2nd defendant's electoral panel and electoral appeal committee for the conduct of the Delta State House of Assembly primaries held on the 29th day of November, 2014, the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\\n\\nHe sought for the following reliefs consequent upon the determination of the foregoing questions.\\n(1) A declaration that the plaintiff having won the received (sic) the certificate of result as the winner of the Ughelli South Constituency, Delta State House of Assembly primaries conducted by the National Working Committee of the 2nd defendant, is the rightful and lawful candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly election slated for the 11th day of April 2015. \\n(2) A declaration that the 1st2\\n and 2nd defendants' surreptitious substitution of the plaintiff's name with the 3rd defendant's name as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly Ughelli South Constituency election slated for the 11th day of April 2015 in total disregard of the result of the primaries, report of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) electoral panel is contrary to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) and therefore unlawful, illegal and of no effect whatsoever.\\n(3) A declaration that any step taken by the defendant in furtherance of the unlawful substitution of the plaintiff with the 3rd defendant is disregard (sic) of the result of the primaries conducted by the National Working Committee of the PDP, report of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Electoral Panel, the People Democratic Party Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) is a nullity.\\n(4) An order reinstating the name of the plaintiff as the lawful and rightful candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency election3\\n slated for the 11th&nbsp;day of April, 2015.\\n(5) An order nullifying the election of the 3rd defendant into the Delta State of Assembly, Ughelli South constituency held on the 11th day of April, 2015.\\n(6) An order nullifying and or setting aside the certificate of return issued by the 1st defendant to the 3rd defendant on the basis of the election held on 11th April 2015 on the ground that the said election amount to a nullity.\\n(7) An order directing the 1st defendant to issue a certificate of return to the plaintiff as the duly elected member of the Delta State House of Assembly representing Ughelli South constituency.\\n(8) An order directing the 3rd defendant to refund all monies, salaries, allowances and or benefits collected and received by him as a member representing Ughelli South constituency in the Delta State House of Assembly from the date (sic) swearing in until judgment is delivered.\\n(9) GENERAL DAMAGES\\nGeneral damages against the defendants jointly and severally in the sum of N500,000,000.00 (five hundred million naira)\\n\\nBy the order of the trial Court granted on 26/10/2015, the originating summons was amended. See pages4\\n 152-296 of vol.1 of the record of appeal.\\n\\nRespective counsel after entering conditional appearance on behalf of their client (i.e. 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants) and joining issues with the Appellant also filed separate motions challenging the competence of the action by the Appellant and the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the suit. Issues were also joined by the Appellant on the 2nd and 3rd Defendants/Respondents notice of preliminary objections.\\n\\nThe summary of the case of the plaintiff/appellant against the defendants/respondents at the Lower Court as can be gleaned from the amended originating summons is that both appellant, the 3rd respondent and other aspirants were contestants at primary election of the 2nd respondent, (Peoples Democratic Party) conducted on the 29th day of November 2014 seeking for the second respondent's ticket to contest the 11th April 2015 general election to represent Ughelli South constituency of Delta State in the Delta State House of Assembly. The appellant claimed to have won the primary election at the end of poll&nbsp;and his name was forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission (1st5\\n Respondent) as the candidate of the 2nd respondent (PDP). According to him, his name was substituted with that of Mr. Reuben Izeze, the 3rd respondent. Efforts to get his name restored on the list of contestants who won the primary election of 2nd Respondent (PDP) met a brick wall and hence his suit against the Respondent at the Lower Court.\\n\\nAfter the adoption of written addresses on the preliminary objection and processes of respective party in the substantive originating summons, the trial Court on the 5th day of April 2016 delivered its considered judgment wherein it upheld the preliminary objections by the 2nd and 3rd respondents and struck out the suit of the appellant.\\n\\nDissatisfied with the said judgment hence this appeal which was registered vide the notice of appeal filed on the 28th day of April 2016, containing fifteen grounds.\\n\\nI reproduce herein under the grounds of appeal minus the particulars for ease of reference. (See pages 1738-1763 of the record of appeal vol. 3).\\n\\nGROUNDS OF APPEAL\\n(1) The learned trial judge erred in law when he struck out the plaintiff/appellants claim on the ground that the Court lacked the necessary6\\n jurisdiction to entertain the suit as constituted.\\n(2) The learned trial judge erred in law when he struck out the plaintiff's suit on the ground that the originating summons was filed before the leave of Court to issue and serve the originating process outside the jurisdiction of the Court was first sought and obtained.\\n(3) The learned trial judge erred in law when he set aside the service of the originating process and consequently struck out the plaintiff's/appellant's suit on the ground that there was no proper service of the originating process on the defendants/respondents.\\n(4) The learned trial judge erred in law when he struck out the plaintiff's suit on the ground that the originating summons was not properly endorsed for service outside the jurisdiction of the Court as prescribed by the Sheriff and Civil Process Act.\\n(5)&nbsp;The learned trial judge misdirected himself when he held that since his copy of the originating process was not endorsed for service out of the jurisdiction of the Court, it presupposes that the originating summons served on the 1st and 2nd defendants were not so endorsed and thereby came7\\n to a wrong conclusion in law by striking out the plaintiff's claim.\\n(6) The learned trial judge erred in law when he struck out the plaintiff's suit on the ground that the suit was statute barred.\\n(7) The learned trial judge misdirected himself in law when he relied on the 2nd and 3rd defendants/respondents defence to the amended originating summons as well as the affidavits in support of the motions challenging the jurisdiction of the Court in arriving at the erroneous decision that the plaintiff's claim was statute barred.\\n(8) The learned trial judge erred in law when he struck out the plaintiff's claim and refused to entertain the merit of the claim on grounds of technicality and then entered a perversed final decision.\\n(9) The learned trial judge erred in law when he held that the limitation period started to run from the date that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) the 2nd defendant in the amended originating summons suit its list of nominated candidates to INEC the 1st defendant and not when 1st defendant published its list of candidates to contest the April 11, 2015 election to the Delta State House of8\\n Assembly.\\n(10) The learned trial judge misdirected himself and came to a wrong conclusion in law when he held that the plaintiff now appellant being a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2nd Respondent, ought to know when the list of candidates was sent to the 1st defendant now 1st Respondent (INEC) and ought to have filed the action from the date it was so sent by the 2nd defendant/respondent.\\n(11) The learned trial judge erred in law when he held that indeed this is the end of litigation. Parties in this case cannot therefore be heard on the merit of the case. Having so held this cause of action cannot be heard and determined on the merit as doing so will amount to mere academic exercise.\\n(12) The learned trial judge erred in law when he held that the plaintiff's claim was filed fifteen days (15) outside the limitation period prescribed in Section 2(a) of the Public Officers Protection Act.\\n(13) The learned trial judge erred in law when he suo motu raised the issue of the incompetence of the amended originating summons and consequently struck out the amended originating summons without affording the parties the opportunity9\\n of addressing on the issue.\\n(14) The learned trial judge erred in law when he suo motu raised the issue of the incompetence of the order made by his predecessor brother judge and therefore set aside the order granted by his predecessor on the 20th day of April 2015, granting leave to serve the originating summons outside the jurisdiction of the Court which prayer was not sought for by any of the Defendants/Respondents in their respective applications and written addresses to the originating summons.\\n(15) The learned trial judge by the decision reached suo motu upon which the plaintiff's/Appellant's suit was struck out breached the plaintiff's/appellant's right to fair hearing as well as his access to Court for the full ventilation of his claim and thus reached a final perverse decision.\\nRELIEFS SOUGHT\\nAn order allowing the appeal and setting aside the judgment of the Lower Court delivered on the 5th day of April 2016 and entering judgment in favour of the Appellant as per reliefs (i)-(ix) as contained in his amended originating summons filed and dated the 25th day of May 2015 in accordance with S.15 of the Court of    10\\n Appeal Act.\\n\\nThe record of appeal was compiled and transmitted on 20th May 2014 (three volumes).

They are:\\nAPPELLANT'S ISSUE FOR DETERMINATION\\n(1) Whether the Lower Court was right when it struck out the Appellant's suit on the ground that it lacked the necessary jurisdiction to entertain the claim as postulated in the amended originating summons dated and filed on 21/5/2015. (Grounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)\\n(2) Whether the learned trial judge did not breach the appellant's constitutional right to fair hearing when -\\n(a) He suo motu raised the issue of improper service of the originating summons on the 1st and 2nd respondents.\\n(b) He suo motu raised the issue of incompetence of the amended originating summons;\\n(c) He suo motu raised the issue of leave to issue and serve the originating process outside the jurisdiction of the Court.\\n(d) He suo motu raised the issue of the incompetence of the order made by his14\\n predecessor brother judge made on 20th April 2015, granting leave to the Appellant to serve the originating summons outside the jurisdiction of the Lower Court, and struck out the suit on the said grounds without affording the parties particularly the Appellant the opportunity of addressing on the issues so raised. (Grounds 13, 14 and 15)\\n(3) Whether the Lower Court was right when it struck out the appellant's suit on the ground that the claim was statute barred. (Grounds 5, 7, 9, 10 and 12)\\n(4) Whether this Honourable Court has the power to hear and determine the appellant's claim as contained in his amended originating summons by virtue of S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act, the Lower Court having failed to determine the case on its merit. (Grounds 8 and 11).\\n2ND RESPONDENT ISSUE FOR DETERMINATION\\n(i) Whether in view of the fact that the originating summons was issued without leave and purportedly served without the mandatory endorsement as required by law.\\n(ii) Whether an issue raised and canvassed by parties before a Court of law can be said to have been raised suo motu by the Court.\\n(iii) Whether in view of the fact15\\n that INEC received the list of candidates more than three months before the suit was filed did not render the suit stale for being statute barred.\\n(iv) Whether a matter, the merit of which was not entertained by a trial Court and which matter has serious contentious and unresolved issues can be entertained by the Court of Appeal by recourse to S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act.\\n(v) Whether the Court of Appeal can determine the substantial matter and direct the 1st respondent to issue a certificate of return to the appellant as duly elected when the appellant did not participate in all processes of the said election.\\n3RD RESPONDENT'S ISSUE FOR DETERMINATION\\n(a) Whether in view of the fact that the originating summons was issued without leave and purportedly served without the mandatory endorsement as required by law, the Lower Court was not robbed of the requisite jurisdiction to entertain the suit of the plaintiff/appellant.\\n(b) Whether an issue raised and canvassed by parties before a Court of law can be said to have been raised suo motu by the Court.\\n(c) Whether in view of the fact that INEC received the list of candidates16\\n more than three months before the suit was filed did not render the suit stale or being statute barred.\\n(d) Whether a matter, the merit of which was not entertained by a trial Court and which matter has serious contentious and unresolved issues can be entertained by the Court of Appeal by recourse to Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act.\\n\\nHaving carefully gone through the records of appeal (volumes 1, 2, 3 and the supplementary record) and having regard to the facts upon which the appellant's complaint before the Lower Court is predicated vis-\\u251c\\u00e1-vis the respective issues formulated by the parties which I consider same in substance and purpose, I have decided to determine this appeal by the issues settled by the Appellant. This is informed by my conviction that the appellant's issue would provide answer to questions posed by issues put forward by the 2nd and 3rd respondents.\\n\\nHowever and before the consideration of the appellant's issues for determination, I will endeavour to determine first the respective preliminary objection by the 2nd and 3rd respondents. It will be recalled that somewhere before now I have reproduced17\\n the respective grounds of preliminary objections by the second and third respondents. But for ease of reference I will reproduce them hereinunder. \\n2ND RESPONDENT'S GROUNDS OF OBJECTION\\n(1) Issues 1 and 2 formulated and argued by the appellant in the Appellant's brief are incompetent and liable to be struck out as it is clearly demonstrated at page 3 of the Appellant's brief that the said issues are bad for proliferation of issues as the separate and distinct issues have been distilled simultaneously from grounds 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the notice and ground of appeal as a single ground of appeal cannot be split to produce more than one issue for determination.\\n(2) Issue No. 4 as formulated by the appellant does not arise out of any of the grounds of appeal, it is not related at all to grounds 8 and 11 from which it has been purportedly distilled and it does not relate at all to or arise out of the judgment of the Lower Court appealed against.\\n3RD RESPONDENT'S GROUND OF PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\\nGROUNDS OF OBJECTION\\n(1) Issue No. 4 as formulated by the appellant does not arise out of any of the grounds of appeal,18\\n it is not related at all to grounds 8 and 11 from which it has been purportedly distilled and it does not relate at all to or arise out of the judgment of the Lower Court appealed against.\\n\\nLet me quickly observe that the sole ground of objection by the 3rd Respondent is same in form, substance and objective with ground two of the preliminary objection by the 2nd Respondent. Therefore, I consider it proper and convenient to take the objections together.\\n\\nARGUMENT \\nThe arguments in support of the grounds of objection put together are that the general rules is that issues are formulated from the grounds of appeal but the appellant has violated the rule by distilling issue 1 from grounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and issue 2 from grounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14 and 15. To this, the 2nd Respondent argued that it amounts to proliferation of issues and hence they are bad. He posed the question whether the law allows a party to distill more than one issue from a single ground of appeal. In providing answer to the question, he relied on the case of OKONOBOR V. D. EDEGBE &amp; SONS TRANSPORT CO. LTD. (2010) 17 NWLR (PT. 1221) 181 where the Supreme Court per Onnoghen JSC (present19\\nChief Justice of Nigeria) said -\\n\\\"It is settled law that proliferation of issues is unacceptable in our appellate Courts. While counsel is permitted to formulate an issue out of a ground of appeal, he cannot formulate two issues out of a ground of appeal as in this instant appeal.\\\"\\nSee also OGOYI V. UMAGBA (1995) 9 NWLR (PT. 419) 233; NNONYE V. ANYICHIE&nbsp;(2000) 1 NWLR (PT. 639) 66.Based on the foregoing, he submitted that issues 1 and 2 are therefore defective and bad and should be struck out and the entire argument based on those two issues should be aborted.\\n\\nOn ground two, the contention of both the 2nd and 3rd Respondents is that it is clear from the grounds of appeal themselves and even when read with their particulars that there is no nexus between the ground as formulated and the issue which has been distilled from them. The issue number four as formulated, he added, raised question of whether the power of the Court of Appeal under S. 15 and 16 of the Court of Appeal Act cannot be invoked and not whether the Lower Court was right or wrong in refraining from going into the merit as postulated by the grounds of appeal20\\n from which the issue has been distilled. They argued that there is no relationship between grounds 8 and 11 on one hand and issue 4 on the other hand as formulated by the appellant. They relied on the case of GWEDE V. INEC (2014) 18 NWLR (PT. 1438) 56, where the Supreme Court said:\\n\\\"in any event, the law is settled that for an issue to be valid and competent for consideration by the Court it must arise from a complaint against the decision/judgment on appeal. Where an issue raised in a brief of argument of either the Appellant or Respondent(s) does not arise from any of the grounds of appeal as in the instant case, the issue is incompetent and liable to be struck out.\\\"\\nThey also relied on the following cases SEAGULL OIL LTD. V. MONI PULO LTD. (2011) 15 NWLR (PT. 1271) 525 at 540; AKPAN V. BOB&nbsp;(2010) 17 NWLR (PT. 1223) A21; IDIKA V. ERISI (1988) 2 NWLR (PT. 78) 563 and&nbsp;ASALU V. DAKAN (2006) 5 SC (PT. 111) 120. They urged the Court to strike out issue No. 4. \\n\\nIn response, the learned counsel representing the appellant argued&nbsp;that it is not open to the 3rd Respondent to file preliminary objection against one or more ground and or21\\n issues for determination contained in an appellant appeal where there are other grounds of appeal and or issues that will sustain the appeal. A preliminary objection is only filed to the hearing of an appeal and not against grounds and or issues for determination. He referred to Order 10 R. 1 of the Court of Appeal Rules 2011 and referred to the case of NNPC V. FAMFA OIL LTD (2012) 17 NWLR (PT. 1328) 148 at 186, where Rhodes-Vivour, JSC held:\\n\\\"If I may add to the above, where as in this appeal the preliminary objection was filed against grounds of appeal that can sustain the appeal, a preliminary objection is inappropriate. The respondent ought to have filed a motion on notice since the preliminary objection if successful would not have terminated the hearing of the appeal as there were other ground of appeal to sustain the appeal. Preliminary objection are filed against the hearing of an appeal and not against one or more grounds of appeal which cannot stop the Court from hearing the appeal.\\\"\\n\\nRelying on the case of GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. V. HARRY AKANDE (2010) 18 NWLR (PT. 1225) 596 at P. 185-186 para F-B. He submitted that the 2nd22\\n Respondent's preliminary objection against issues 1, 2 and 4 arising from grounds of appeal out of other competent ground and issues so formulated run fowl of the law and rules of this Court. He urge the Court to dismiss or strike out the objection.\\n\\nHe added that an appellate Court is free to adopt or formulate issues for parties suo motu. He relied on the case of ODUTOLA V. MABOGUNJE (2013) 7 NWLR (PT. 1354) P. 522 at 555-556. Further, he argued that learned counsel for the applicant is either inadvertently misinterpreted and misapplied either deliberately or mischievously set out to mislead this Court by subjecting the judgment of the Court in the foregoing case to a wrongful and selfishly wide interpretation. He contended that an issue could be formulated from more than one ground of appeal but more than one issue cannot be distilled from a ground of appeal. He added that an issue must be distilled from the ground of appeal. He relied on the case of ANOZIA V. NNANI (2015) NWLR (PT. 1461) P. 241 at 250-251; OMONIYI V. ALIBI (2015) 6 NWLR (PT. 1456) P. 589. \\n\\nHis argument on issue 4 that the contention of the 2nd respondent is baseless and ill23\\n proposed and aimed at embarrassing this Court and particularly, the appellant as well as being an infantile attempt at perplexing this honourable Court with irrelevant time wasting concerns which is further rubbished by the well known position of the law that the power bestowed on this Court by Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act and which the Appellant prayed for its invocation is both a right and a privilege conferred by Statute and therefore unquestionable and inalienable even by law or under any guise. He relied on the case of LAMINU V. MAIDUGU (2015) 7 NWLR (PT. 1458) P. 289.\\n\\nHe argued that it is an unquestionable and undeniable power of this Court to do substantial justice where the Lower Court fails in that duty. It is the right of the Appellant to move this Court to exercise the power in his favour and for his privilege having qualified himself for same upon the fulfillment of the conditions set by law. He relied on the case of ARCHIANGA V. A.G., AKWA IBOM STATE (2015) 6 NWLR (PT. 1454) P. 1; KAYILI V. YILBUK (2015) 7 NWLR (PT. 1457) P. 26 at 77.\\n\\nHe urged the Court to hold that the exercise of its powers under S. 15 of the Court of Appeal    24\\n Act is a statutory one which the 2nd Respondent cannot fetter nor can be fettered at all in this appeal. He urged the Court to dismiss the 2nd Respondent's objection for being frivolous and lacking in merit.\\n\\nOn the similar objection by the 3rd Respondent's counsel to grounds 8 and 11 of the Appellant's notice of appeal that they absolutely have no connection with the said ground is to say the least, shocking infantile and an attempt at perplexing the honourable Court with irrelevant time - wasting concerns. It is a baseless and ill proposed argument aimed at embarrassing the Court. He argued that it is not open to the 3rd Respondent to file a preliminary objection against one or more grounds and or issues for determination contained in an appellant's appeal where there are other grounds of appeal and or issue that will sustain the appeal. A preliminary objection against one or more grounds and or issues for determination contained in an appellant's appeal where there are other grounds of appeal and or issues that will sustain the appeal. He argued further that a preliminary objection is only filed to the hearing of an25\\n appeal and not against grounds and or issue for determination. He refer to Or. 10 R. 1 of the Rules and the case of NNPC V. FAMFA OIL LTD. (2012) 17 NWLR (PT. 1328) 148 at 186; GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. V.

MABOGUNJE&nbsp;(2013) 7 NWLR (PT. 1354) P. 522 at 555-556.\\n\\nOn issue No. 4, I have observed that his submission is same in content and substance with that in his response to the ground of objection by the 2nd Respondent which has been reproduced somewhere in this judgment.\\n\\nHe also concluded by urging the Court to hold that the exercise of its power under S.15 of the Court of Appeal Act is a statutory one which the 3rd Respondent cannot fetter nor can be fettered at all in this appeal and should be dismissed for being frivolous and lacking in merit.\\n\\nIn the light of the foregoing arguments for and against, the pertinent question is whether or not the issues are bad for proliferation and whether the Court can exercise its powers in the circumstance of this appeal under S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act.\\n\\nForemost, I consider it pertinent to bring to bear the connotation of an26\\n \\\"issue\\\", put in another way, \\\"what is an issue\\\"? An issue can best be defined as every disputed question of fact. Parties are said to be at issue when one party to an action has answered one another's pleadings in such a manner that they have arrived at some material point or matter of fact they are said to have joined issue and the question raised is called \\\"issue\\\". See the case of OVERSEAS CONSTRUCTION COMPANY (NIGERIA) Ltd. V. CREEK ENTERPRISES (NIG) LTD &amp; ABANDONED PROPERTY AUTHORITY (1985) 12 SC 158 AT 190-191; OKOYE V. N.C. &amp; F. CO. LTD. (1991) 7 SC (PT. 111) 33 at 70-71 and EKE V. OKWARANYIA (2001) 4 SC (PT. 11) 71 at 93.\\n\\nBearing the foregoing in mind and considering the facts of this case, the grounds of appeal in contention and the issues thereto, it appears to me that the second Respondent misconceived the position of the Court on what is an issue. It is trite that an issue raised in an appeal must relate to the ground of appeal but not distilling more than one issue from a ground of appeal. However an issue may emanate from more than one ground of appeal. See OKONOBOR V. D. EDEGBE &amp; SONS    27\\n TRANSPORT CO. LTD. (2010) 17 NWLR (PT. 1221) P. 180; ABIOLA V.

ALIBI (2015) 6 NWLR (PT. 1456) P. 572 AT 589.\\nOnce an issue can be linked to a ground of appeal the question of whether it is competent is positively answered. Having said this, I conclude that the objection to grounds 8 and 11 is in the realm of misconception and accordingly overruled.\\n\\nOn the objection against issue No. 4 which was contended by the 3rd Respondent which in effect run thus:\\nISSUE 4\\nWhether this Honourable Court has the power to hear and determine the Appellant's claims as contained in his amended originating summons by virtue of S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act, the Lower Court having failed to determine the case on its merit.\\n\\nI have read the argument on both sides. The germane question is whether or not this Court is vested with the power to in circumstances like the one at hand step into the shoes of the trial Court and make the28\\n pronouncement that it considers appropriate having regard to the claim of the complainant who is the Appellant in this case at hand. My reaction to the foregoing is in the affirmative. It is not only under S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act that such power is vested in this Court. Similar provision can be found under Or. 20 R. 11(1) and (2) of the Court of Appeal Rules 2016 which read thus:\\nORDER 20 RULE 11(1) AND (2)\\n11(1) \\\"The Court shall have power to give any judgment or make any order that ought to have been made and to make such further order as the case may require including any order as to cost.\\\"\\n11(2) \\\"The power contained in Sub-rule (1) of this Rule may be exercised by the Court, notwithstanding that the Appellant may have asked that part only of a decision may be received or varied, and may also be exercised in favour of all or any of the Respondents or parties, although such Respondents or parties may not have appealed from or complained of the decision\\\". \\nFrom the foregoing it is crystal clear that under both Order 20 R. 11 (1) &amp; (2) of the Court of Appeal Rules 2016 and S. 15 of the Court of Appeal Act,29\\nthis Court has the power to step into the shoes of the Lower Court and make appropriate order and or judgment in any given matter before it. See the case of LAMINU VS. MAIDUGU (2015) 7 NWLR PART. 1458 PAGE 289 at PAGE 316.\\nIn my view what the Appellant did simplifiers is merely inviting the Court to invoke its powers under that law. He has not out stepped his bounds. It is not a command. It is left for the Court to decide whether in a given situation, it can invoke its powers under those provisions. See ARCHIANGA VS. A.G. AKWA IBOM STATE (2015) 6 NWLR PART 1454 PAGE 1 at PAGE 71; KAYILI VS. YILBUK (2015) 7 NWLR PART 1450 PAGE 26 at 77. Where the Court held as follow:\\n\\\"The law has enjoined the Court of Appeal on the authority of Section 16 of the Court of Appeal Act formerly Section 15, to make any order necessary for determining the real question in controversy in an appeal, and can as well make an interim order or grant any injunction which the trial Court is authorised to make. The order can be made for the purpose of doing justice to parties. It need not be specifically claimed where it is obvious and should be made as a30\\n consequence.\\\"\\nIn the case of ADO IBRAHIM &amp; CO. LTD VS. BCC LIMITED (2007) 5 NWLR PART 1058 PAGE 538 at 557 the Apex Court said thus:\\n\\\"Section 16 of the Court of Appeal Act 1976, which is now Section 15 of the Court of Appeal Act. Cap C.36 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, when read together with Order 1 Rule 20 and Order 3 Rule 23 of the Court of Appeal Rules 2002, vests ample powers in the Court of Appeal such that it can hear an appeal before it by way of a re-hearing and can make any necessary order which in its opinion, can effectively dispose of not only the appeal before it, but also the entire suit place before the trial Court.\\\"\\n\\nHaving gone this far it is my candid view that this ground of objection by the 3rd Respondent and the argument thereto can not fly. To me, the argument at best can be described as a toothless bull dog. Accordingly, I overrule the ground of objection.\\n\\nIn all, both the grounds of objection by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents respectively fail and are dismissed in their entirely. \\n\\nI will now proceed to the main appeal. But before doing that, I consider it appropriate at this stage to31\\n put on record that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents Cross Appeals. I hereinunder reproduce their respective processes in that regard. \\n\\n2ND RESPONDENT CROSS/APPELLANT NOTICE OF CROSS APPEAL\\nThe 2nd Respondent's amended notice of cross appeal dated 9th February, 2017 was filed on 10th February, 2017.\\nThe grounds of the cross appeal by the 2nd respondent are:\\n2ND RESPONDENT'S GROUND OF CROSS APPEAL\\n(1) The learned trial judge erred in law when he held that the case can conveniently and comfortably disposed off based on the documents attached to the affidavit in support and counter affidavit and that there is no need for this Court to call evidence in the instant case even in the face of the conflicting affidavit evidence of the parties and thereby come to a wrong decision. \\n(2) The learned trial judge misdirected himself in law when he relied on the case of GBILEVE V. ADDINGI (2014) 16 NWLR (PT.1433) 384 at 417 para C-G to refuse the contention of the 2nd defendant/cross/appellant's counsel that the Court should call for oral evidence.\\nRELIEF SOUGHT\\nTo allow the cross appeal and to strike out the suit of the32\\n plaintiff cross respondent.\\n3RD RESPONDENT GROUND OF CROSS/APPEAL\\nThe 3rd Respondent cross/appellant amended notice of cross appeal dated 16th day of February 2017 was filed on the 20th day of February 2017.\\nGROUND OF CROSS APPEAL\\n(1) The learned trial judge erred in law when held (sic) that the suit as laid before the Lower Court could have been disposed on the basis of the affidavit put before the Court even in the face of serious conflict on the facts.\\nRELIEF SOUGHT \\nTo allow the cross appeal and to strike out the suit of the plaintiff/1st cross/respondent.\\n2ND RESPONDENT CROSS/APPELLANT'S BRIEF OF ARGUMENT\\nThe 2nd Respondent's cross/appellant's brief of argument was filed on 10th day of February, 2017 and deemed as properly filed and served on 22nd February 2017. In the said brief, he distilled the following sole issue for determination.\\nISSUE FOR DETERMINATION\\nWhether the learned trial judge was right when he held that the case can be conveniently disposed of based on the documents attached to the affidavits without recourse to oral evidence even in the face of manifesting and unresolved33\\n conflicts in the affidavit evidence coupled with conflicting documents.\\n\\n3RD RESPONDENT CROSS APPELLANT'S BRIEF OF ARGUMENT\\nThe amended 3rd respondent cross/appellant's brief of argument dated 16th February 2017 was filed on 20th February 2017. The said brief was deemed as properly filed and served on 22nd February, 2017. Therein, he distilled the following lone issue for determination.\\nISSUE FOR DETERMINATION\\nWhether the learned trial judge was right to have held that the fact put forward in the various affidavits and counter affidavits were not conflicting enough to warrant the Court ordering the parties to file pleadings or ordering oral evidence to be led.\\n\\nIn response to the respective cross appellant's brief of argument, the Appellant/Cross/Respondent filed separate briefs of argument. The briefs were filed on the 2nd day of March 2017.\\n\\nTherein, he distilled one issue each. The issues are same in form, content and purpose. I hereinunder reproduce the issue. \\nAPPELLANT/CROSS/RESPONDENT'S ISSUE FOR DETERMINATION\\nWhether the learned trial judge was right when he held thus:\\n\\\"I have34\\n considered the processes filed by the parties on this case and I am of the humble view that this case does not fall within the class of cases that will require oral evidence, the case can be conveniently and comfortably disposed off based on the documents attached to the affidavits in support and counter affidavits.\\\" (see page 1734 vol. 3 of the record)\\n\\nHaving put on record the foregoing processes by parties in respect of the cross appeal, I will now proceed with my consideration of the issues in the main appeal.\\n\\nMAIN APPEAL\\nISSUE ONE\\nWhether the Lower Court was right when it struck out the Appellants suit on the ground that it lacked the necessary jurisdiction to entertain the claim as postulated in the amended originating summons dated and filed on 21/5/2015.\\n\\nThe argument of the learned counsel to the Appellant is that the learned trial judge was wrong when he held that he lacked the requisite jurisdiction to hear and determine the suit between the parties on the ground that the originating summons for service outside the jurisdiction or territory of the Court was not properly endorsed in the manner required by Section 97 of    35\\n the Sheriff and Civil Process Act and that the appellant did not apply for and obtain the leave of the Court to issue and serve same on the 1st and 2nd respondents outside the jurisdiction of the Court. He argued that what the law requires in this regard is for the appellant to seek leave to serve the originating summons outside the jurisdiction of the Court once same has been issued and not leave to issue the originating summons itself. It is therefore wrong to assume and or hold that obtaining leave to issue a writ or an originating summons as in this case is a condition precedent and a mandatory requirement of the law as held by the learned trial judge. Further, he submit that once the appellant has issued the originating summons as a matter of right the appellant only needed to apply for leave of the Court to serve outside the jurisdiction of the trial Court on the one or more of the respondent(s) residing outside the Court's jurisdiction where that is the case. He argued that in this circumstance, what is required of the appellant is compliance with Or. 6 R. 13(1) and 14(1) of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 2009 and S. 97 of the    36\\n Sheriff and Civil Process Act is to apply to the trial Court for leave to serve the said originating summons on the party residing outside the Court's jurisdiction and which the appellant rightly did. He contended that by the clear provisions of S. 97 and 98 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act, it is the copy of the originating process to be served on the party resident outside the jurisdiction of the trial Court that must carry such mandatory endorsement being a concur writ and not every copy. He relied on the case of ENTERPRISE BANK LTD. V. AROSO (2014) 3 NWLR (PT. 1394) P. 256 at P. 294. Further, he submitted that in line with the pronouncement of the Supreme Court in the above case, the originating summons having been issued and necessary application having been made for leave to serve outside the jurisdiction of the Court as the Appellant did in this case, he has satisfied all that is required of him by the law to confer jurisdiction on the Court. All what the trial Court would look for is whether the appellant made the necessary application for leave to be granted to him to serve the originating processes in the suit on the respondent resident37\\n outside the jurisdiction of the trial Court. It is glaring from the record that the appellant applied for and obtained the leave of the trial Court to serve the originating summons on the 1st and 2nd respondents who are resident outside the Court's jurisdiction. Further, he contended that there is no requirement on the part of the Appellant, either in law or in practice, to first apply for leave of Court to issue an originating summons before applying for leave to issue the said process outside the jurisdiction of the Court. What the law requires by virtue of S.97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act is for the Appellant to apply for leave of Court to serve the issued processes on the Respondents resident outside the jurisdiction of the Court with mandatory endorsement thereon. He submitted that the learned trial judge misinterpreted and thus misapplied the law by the pronouncement of the Court that the appellant ought to first apply for an order to issue the process and after, that for service outside jurisdiction. The reliance of the Court on the principles in the decided case of TOUTON S.A. V. GRIMALDI COMPAGNIA DI NAVIGATION S.P.A. &amp; 2 ORS., the38\\n learned trial judge misdirected himself when he held that the Court cannot rely on such an information merely because the endorsement is not contained in the Judge's or Court's copy and so is unreliable and not acceptable. He argued further that in the face of the affidavit evidence of the bailiff contained at page 1774-1785 in vol. 3 of the record of appeal, the Lower Court was adequately informed of the fact of proper service with the mandatory endorsement of the originating summons on the 1st and 2nd Respondents as contained therein. Proof of service of the originating summons on the 1st and 2nd respondents with the mandatory endorsement. He referred to pages 1774-1785 of the record of appeal. He relied on the case of AGBAREH V. MIMRA (2008) 2 NWLR (PT. 1071) P. 378 at pages 410-411; NDAYAKO V. DANTORO (2004) 13 NWLR (PT. 889) P. 187.\\n\\nHe submitted that in the light of the foregoing where the 2nd and 3rd respondents having acknowledged the regular service of the originating summons in this case by filing processes and pleadings, they have therefore taken step and participated in the proceedings from inception until judgment, therefore, it39\\n was too late in the proceedings at that stage to be heard to complain of irregularity of service. He relied on the case of ENTERPRISE BANK LTD. V. AROSO (supra) at page 295.\\n\\nHe argued that assuming without conceding that the staff of the trial Court's registry failed to properly endorse the originating summons to be served outside the jurisdiction of the trial Court, that would amount to non compliance with form. He relied in the case of N.B.C. PLC. V. UBANI (2014) 4 NWLR (PT. 1398) P. 421 AT PAGES 449; UGBA V. SUSWAM (2014) 14 NWLR (PT. 1427) P. 264 AT P. 308, where the Supreme Court held thus:\\n\\\"A party cannot be heard to complain against any irregularity which he was a part of, having accepted, waived or acquiesced. In the instant case, the hearing of the preliminary objection which led to the ruling of 8/12/2012 at the time the Supreme Court did which was subsequently ruled upon was at the instance of all the parties including the applicant and they could not be heard to complain of an irregularity which they were part of. The procedure adopted by the Court in conducting the proceeding having been agreed by parties, the applicants40\\n waived their right and could not be allowed to approbate and reprobate.\\\"\\n\\nThe Respondents having taken steps and filed separate motions for extension of time to bring in their respective counter affidavits and written addresses in opposition to the appellant's amended originating summons, he relied on the case of PANALPINA WORLD TRANSPORT HOLDING AG V. CEDDI CORPORATION LTD. (2012) 2 NWLR (PT. 1285) P. 465.\\n\\nHe submitted finally on this issue that the learned trial judge erred in law when he held that he lacked the necessary jurisdiction to entertain the appellants suit on the grounds that the originating summons as well as the amended originating summons were not properly endorsed by the appellant before service on the 1st and 2nd respondent as required by S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act that the appellant did not first and foremost seek and obtain the leave of the Court to issue the originating summons before service on the 1st and 2nd respondents and that the appellant belatedly obtained the leave of the Court to serve the originating summons outside the jurisdiction of the Court.\\n\\n2ND RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENT\\n41\\n The 2nd Respondent contended that the law has always treated a breach of S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act as it relates to failure to obtain leave as it relates to failure to obtain leave to sue the defendant out of jurisdiction and failure to properly endorse the originating summons as required by law as jurisdiction and threshold issue. He relied on SKENCONSULT NIG. LTD. V. UKEY (1981) 1 SC 6; ODU'A INVESTMENT CO. LTD. V. TALABI (1997) 10 NWLR (PT. 523).\\n\\nHe argued that the issue is not a matter of course but there are conditions precedent which must be satisfied. Where a process which requires leave before it can issue is issued without the requisite leave, it means that the jurisdiction of the Court has not been properly invoked and the process is incompetent and liable to be set aside. He referred to the case of&nbsp;AGIP (NIG) V. AGIP PETROL INT'L (2010) 5 NWLR (PT. 1187) 348.\\n\\nHe argued that it is clear from the records that there is no endorsement as mandatorily required by law on the originating summons and there is nothing to show that as at 9/4/2015 when the said originating summons was issued by the registry or the Lower Court, that42\\n the leave of the Court was applied for and duly obtained as at that date 9/4/2015. He contended that what appears on page 50 of the records of appeal is a motion ex parte filed on 10/4/2015 (after the originating summons had already issued 24 hours earlier) seeking leave to issue and serve the processes on the 1st and 2nd defendants outside the jurisdiction of this Court. He argued that the word \\\"issued and\\\" were cancelled without any initialing on the face of the said application. The official endorsement on the said process show clearly that it was filed on 10/4/2015. This he said is evident from the date on which the Commissioner for Oaths commissioned the affidavit in support of the said motion at page 53 of the record. He added that it is clear from the records that it was on 20/4/15 more than 10 days after the originating summons was filed that the trial Court purported to grant the application only as to issuance. He submitted that the originating summons was issued without leave of the Court and that the endorsement for service outside jurisdiction was not done. Failure to obtain leave of Court before signing or sealing of a writ for43\\n service out of jurisdiction is a fundamental breach which extinguishes life out of such a writ. He relied on the case of DREXEL ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES LTD &amp; ORS VS. TRANS INTERNATIONAL BANK LTD &amp; ORS (2008) 18 NWLR (PT.119) PG. 388 at PG. 437.\\n\\nHe argued further that the Appellant cannot be heard to contend that there is a lapse which is attributable to the registry of the Lower Court. The Appellant was tardy in presenting his documents before the Court. He contended that there is a total difference in Law between the proof of service of a process and the process served. This issue is not whether there was proof of service but whether the process served was properly issued and whether the mandatory endorsements required by Law to be placed on such process was placed on the process. The contention of the Appellant is that the Respondent took step in the proceedings and therefore waived the non compliance is untenable. He submitted that the records shows clearly that the Respondent first challenged the competence of the processes, it was the Lower Court that insisted that since the proceedings were commenced by originating summons, it would44\\n take the objection along the substantive suit hence the motions challenging the competence of the suit were filed long before the 2nd and 3rd Defendants filed their counter affidavit to the originating summons on the merits. He also referred to Order 29 (2) &amp; (3) of the Federal High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2009. The defendants having raised the issue timeously and having argued, it cannot be taken to have waived their right. He relied on AUTO IMPORT EXPORT VS. ADEBAYO (2005) 19 NWLR (PT.959) 44; HAIGHTONS (WA) LTD VS. AJAO (1975) 1 SC (REPRINT) 8; SANI&nbsp;VS. OKENE L.G. TRADITIONAL COUNCIL (2008) 12 NWLR (PT.1102) 691. \\n\\nOn this note he urged the Court to resolve this issue against the Appellant and in favour of the Respondent and to dismiss this appeal.\\n\\nIn the course of reading the processes by the respective Respondents i.e the 2nd and 3rd Respondent, I found that the briefs of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents are same in substance and content. If I may add, they are word for word, hence they are the same. Therefore, I would no longer review the argument by the 3rd Respondent on this issue. Rather, I would adopt the foregoing for the 3rd Respondent.\\n45\\n Consequent upon a careful reading of the submission of the respective learned counsel representing the Appellant on one hand and that of the 2nd and 3rd Respondents on the other and the consideration and conclusion of the trial Court on this issue, it is done on me here that what is in contention between parties is whether or not the originating summons was issued in compliance with the provision of Order 6 Rule 13 - 17 of the Federal High Court Civil Procedure Rules 2009 and S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act.\\n\\nBefore zooming into the consideration of this issue, I consider it proper to reproduce the provision of Order 6 Rule 13, 14 (1) (2) 17 (1) (a) &amp; (b) (2) and Section 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act.\\nOrder 6 Rule 13 :-\\n\\\"Service out of jurisdiction of a writ of summons or notice of a writ of summons may be allowed by the Court or a Judge in Chambers whenever -\\n13(g) Any person out of jurisdiction is a necessary or proper party to an action properly brought against some other party within the jurisdiction; or\\n14(1) Every application for leave to serve a writ or notice on a Defendant46\\n out of the jurisdiction shall be supported by affidavit or other evidence stating that in the belief of the deponent the plaintiff has a good cause of action and showing in what place or country the defendant is or probably may be found, and the grounds upon which application is made.\\n(2) No such leave shall be granted unless it is made sufficiently to appear to the Court or a Judge in Chamber that the cause is a proper one for service out of jurisdiction under these Rules.\\n17 (1) Service out of jurisdiction may be allowed by the Court or a Judge in Chambers of the following processes or of notices thereof, that is to say\\n(a) An originating summons, where the proceeding begun by an originating summons might have been begun by a writ of summons under these Rules. \\n(b) Any originating summons, petition, notice of motion or other originating proceedings-\\n(1) --------\\n(ii) Under any law or enactment under which proceedings can be commenced otherwise than by writ of summon.\\\"\\nSHERIFF AND CIVIL PROCESS ACT CHAPTER 86 LFN 2004\\nSECTION 97\\n\\\"Every writ of47\\n summons for service under this part out of the state or the Capital Territory in which it was issued shall, in addition to any other endorsement or notice required by the Law of such state or the Capital Territory, have endorsed thereon a notice to the following effect (that is to say)\\n\\\" This summons (or as the case may be) is to be served out of the State (or as the case may be ) --------- and in the ------ State (or as the case may be)\\\"\\nS. 98 A writ of summons for service out of the State or the Capital Territory in which it was issued may be issued as a concurrent writ with one for service within such State or the Capital Territory and shall in that case be marked as concurrent.\\\"\\n\\nHaving set out the two provisions, I will go into the records to fish out what precipitated this issue. From the records it is obvious that this issue is borne out of the conclusion of the Court on the notice of preliminary objection by both the 2nd and 3rd Respondents wherein they challenge the competence and validity of the originating summons issued and served on them being parties resident outside48\\n the jurisdiction of the Court. See the motion by the 2nd Respondent to that effect on pages 379 - 393 of volume one of the Record of Appeal \\n(2) Motion on notice by the 3rd Respondent for the preliminary objection on pages 447 - 458 of volume one of Record of Appeal.\\n\\nThe learned trial Judge of the Lower Court after hearing both parties on the preliminary objection and adoption of processes by all counsel on the main suit in his considered judgment struck out the suit of the Appellant for failure to comply with the provision of Section 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act. See pages 1694 - 1737 of volume 3 of the Record for the judgment of the Court. At page 1722 - 1723 of the said record the Court concluded as follow:\\n\\\" ------ Following from the above that is having held that there was no endorsement on the Court's copy which is the original copy of the amended originating summons for service on the 1st and 2nd Defendant in Abuja, outside the jurisdiction of the Court in compliance with the provision of S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act, the said amended originating summons is null and void and49\\n of no effect whatsoever. Put another way the process is declared incompetent and liable to be set aside, I say so because any order emanating from this case cannot be enforced against the 3rd Defendant who is an individual left in the case.\\nI belief (sic) the case of OHAKIM VS. AGBASO (SUPRA) cited and relied on by the Plaintiff's counsel is distinguishable or does not support the case of the Plaintiff.\\nConsequently, the amended originating summons is struck out on this point.\\\"\\n\\nFurther to this is the conclusion of the Court on the issue of leave to issue and serve the originating process outside the jurisdiction of the Court. See pages 1723 - 1729 of the record of Appeal volume 3. At page 1729 the Court said thus: \\n\\\"--------- The above decision which is binding on the Court is on all fours with this objection. The amended originating summons is incompetent and liable to be set aside. The said amended originating summons is hereby struck out on this point.\\nHaving struck out Plaintiff's case as it affects the 1st and 2nd Respondents, I have no doubt in my mind that the entire suit has collapsed or50\\n crumbled as earlier stated. \\nConsequently, I find it appropriate to state here that the case ought to be struck out on this issue and I so hold as decided in the case of OKOLO VS. UNION BANK OF NIGERIA LTD (2004) ALL FWLR (PT. 197) 981. At 992 PARAS E.G the Apex Court as per TOBI JSC (as he then was) had this to say\\n'Jurisdiction is the pillar upon which the entire case stand ..................\\\"\\nAs clearly and elaborately held by his Lordship the great jurist in the decision above, the instant case has equally crumbed. Indeed this is the end of the litigation. Parties in this case cannot therefore be heard on the merit of the case.\\nConsequently, issue two is therefore resolved in favour of all the Defendants and against the Plaintiff. \\\"\\n\\nI have taken pains to reproduce the foregoing for purpose of better understanding.\\n\\nLet me quickly note that the Court51\\n either inadvertently or deliberately did not refer to the provision of Order 6 of the Rule of the trial Lower Court. It is in my view that the rule of the Court where the case of the Appellant was instituted is the first point of call before the Sheriff and Civil process Act.\\n\\nHaving said this, I am of the view that the question for consideration in this issue is very narrow. That is whether in view of the two provisions, whether the originating process issued by the Appellant for service on the 1st and 2nd Respondents at Abuja which is outside the jurisdiction of the trial Court is valid and in compliance with the law. \\n\\nBearing in mind Order 6 Rules 13-17 of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, and upon a careful reading of the said provisions, I cannot find in the said provisions where it is required that leave of the Court should be obtained before the originating process is issued. All the provisions prescribed is that leave should be obtained before the originating summons issued for service on a party outside the jurisdiction of the Court is served. It therefore follows that the contention of the Court that leave should be sought and52\\n obtained before the originating process by the Appellant is issued and served is not correct and far from the contemplation of Order 6 of Federal High Court (Civil procedure) Rules. Agreed, both provision prescribe seeking of leave to serve but not to issue. I accordingly so hold.\\n\\nFurther to this the said provision also provides for issuance of concurrent writ. That is to say where in an action the defendants to the plaintiff's action are resident partly within and partly outside the jurisdiction of the Court as in this appeal at hand where the 1st and 2nd respondents are outside the jurisdiction and the 3rd respondent is within the jurisdiction of the Court. In the case at hand, it is only those processes to be served on the 1st and 2nd defendant/respondents that needed the leave of the Court to serve outside the jurisdiction. See the case of ENTERPRISE BANK LTD. V. AROSO (2014) 3 NWLR (PT. 1394) P. 294, where the Apex Court has this to say:\\n\\\"The combined effect of Or. 5 R. 1 and 6 of the High Court of Ekiti State (Civil Procedure) Rules is that a writ of summons shall be issued by the Registrar and can only be served on the adverse53\\n party residing out of jurisdiction after leave is obtained. In the instance case, once the Plaintiff/Respondent present his writ of summons for service out of jurisdiction dated 22nd August 1997 and his application ex parte for leave to serve the writ of summons on the appellant in Ondo State dated 22nd August 1997 to the Registrar as was done on 22nd August 1997 and the appropriate fees paid, in the eye of the law, the plaintiff respondent had done all that was required of him for proceedings to commence. His responsibility came to an end. It was then the responsibility of the Registrar to ensure compliance with the law. The plaintiff respondent was not liable for the incompetent handling of his application process by staff in the registry of the High Court.\\\"\\n\\nA quick look at pages 1677-1679 of volume 3 of the record of appeal exposes the fact that the appellant sought and was granted leave to serve his originating summons on the 1st and 2nd respondents outside the jurisdiction of the Court. The said order was granted by Hon. Justice M. Shittu Abubakar on the 20th day of April, 2015. Having done this, I am of the view that the appellant has properly54\\n and completely discharged the responsibility placed on him under the combined provision of Or. 6 R. 13-17 of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules and S. 97 and 98 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act. The conclusion of the learned trial judge of the Lower Court on page 1723 of volume 3 of the record of appeal has no foundation or basis. I am a bit worried by the reaction of the Court to the affidavit of service by the bailiff of the Court (see the said affidavit of service on pages 1774-1785 of vol. 3 of the record of appeal). Not this alone, even the acknowledgement of the counsel to the 2nd and 3rd respondents of the receipt of the processes in their final written address did not have any effect on the mind of the Court. See pages 1717-1718 of vol. 3 of the record. It is my candid view that the affidavit of service by the bailiff also forms part of the Court's record which the trial Court ought to put into consideration in his findings. See AGBAREH V. MIMRA (2008) 2 NWLR (PT. 1071 P. 378; NDAYAKO V. DANTORO (2004) 13 NWLR 889) P. 187.\\n\\nOn the provision of S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act, it is my view that once a plaintiff55\\n delivers his writ to the Registrar of the Court, and has duly obtained the leave of the Court to serve same on a defendant who is residing outside the jurisdiction of the Court, he has discharged the responsibility imposed on him by law. See PANALPINA WORLD TRANSPORT HOLDING AG. V. CEDDI CORPORATION LTD. (2012) 2 NWLR (PT. 1285) P. 465. Let me add that even assuming without conceding that the said endorsement is not made, it does not render the writ invalid because such omission if at all is available would merely amount to an irregularity.\\n\\nOn this note, I am left with no other option than to come to the conclusion that the Court misdirected itself and has a misconception of the provision of Or. 6 Rules 13-17 of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure)Rules and S.97 and 98 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act by concluding that the appellant did not seek nor obtain the leave to issue the originating summons. Leave to issue as I said before, is not part of the requirements of Or. 6 Rules 13-17 of the Federal High Court (Civil Procedure) Rule. \\n\\nAccordingly, I resolve this issue against the respondents and in favour of the appellant. That is to say56\\n that the Lower Court was wrong when it struck out the appellant's suit on the ground that it lacked the necessary jurisdiction to hear and determine the suit based on the fact that the originating summons for service outside the jurisdiction or territory of the Court was not properly endorsed in the manner prescribed by Section 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act and that the appellant did not apply for and obtain the leave of the Court to issue and serve the summons on the 1st and 2nd respondents outside the jurisdiction of the Court. In response to the statement of learned trial Judge in his conclusion when he said \\n\\\"indeed this is the end of the litigation, parties cannot therefore be heard on the merit of the case .......\\\". This Court is saying that litigation between the parties is yet to end but continues.\\n\\nI accordingly set aside the order of the Lower Court striking out the suit of the appellant in Suit No. FHC/WR/CS/53/2015. I hold that the originating process by the appellant was properly issued and served on the 1st and 2nd respondents in compliance with the provision of Or. 6 Rules 13-17 of the Federal High    57\\n Court Civil Procedure Rule and S. 97 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act.\\n\\nHaving gone this far, and considering the fact that the suit of the appellant was sent packing on the preliminary objection without considering the substantive suit, I do not consider it proper to go further with the consideration of other issues.\\n\\nOn that note also I feel there is no need to consider the cross appeal of the 2nd and 3rd respondents in the circumstance of the fact of this appeal. What I have in mind is that since the trial Court was of the view that he has no jurisdiction to determine the suit of the appellant for the reasons herein before stated and this Court having found that the originating process of the appellant was properly issued and served on the first and second respondents thereby conferring jurisdiction on the Lower Court, this suit has to be remitted to the Lower Court for trial on its merit.\\n\\nBy this, therefore, I conclude that the appeal is meritorious and it is hereby allowed.\\n\\nThe judgment of Lower Court in suit FHC/WR/CS/53/2015 delivered on the 5th day of April 2016 Coram Hon. Justice E.A. Obile is hereby set aside.\\n\\nThe suit is58\\n hereby remitted to the Hon. Chief Judge of the Federal High Court for reassignment to another Judge of the Federal High Court other than Hon. Justice E. A. Obile for expeditious determination on merit.\\n\\nA cost of N100,000.00 is awarded in favour of the Appellant and against the Respondents jointly.\\n\\nPHILOMENA MBUA EKPE, J.C.A.: I have had the privilege of reading in draft, the judgment just delivered by my learned brother ONIYANGI, JCA. My Lord has very carefully and painstakingly delved into all the issues in this appeal. I totally agree with the reasoning and conclusions reached therein that this appeal has merit and ought to be allowed. It is also my humble view that this appeal is adjudged meritorious and is consequently allowed.&nbsp;\\n\\nAccordingly, the judgment of the Lower Court in Suit No.FHC/WR/CS/53/2015 delivered on the 5th day of April 2015 coram E. A. Obile J is set aside. This suit is, in consequence, hereby remitted to the Hon. Chief Judge of the Federal High Court for re-hearing and determination on the merits.\\n\\nI abide by his Lordship's order as to costs of N100,000.00 awarded in favour of the59\\n Appellant in the lead judgment.\\n\\nMOORE ASEIMO ABRAHAM ADUMEIN, J.C.A.: I had the opportunity of reading before now the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Mudashiru Nasiru Oniyangi, JCA.\\n\\nMy learned brother has exhaustively dealt with all the issues in this appeal.

A Declaration that the Plaintiff is both the legal and equitable owner of all that large piece or parcel of land measuring 928.804 Sq. Meters registered as No. 4 at page 4 in Volume 157 in the Land Registry and situate at R. S. Okeaya Inneh Estate Layout at Isiohor near Bendel Development and Planning Authority Housing Estate, Ugbowo, Benin City.\\n2. A Declaration that the Plaintiff is entitled to possession and statutory right of occupancy of the said piece of land measuring 928.804 square Meters delineated in Survey plan No. ISO/BD/09/88 within the larger areas of land of K.S. OKEAYA INNEH'S Estate Layout at Isiohor, near Bendel Development and Planning Authority housing Estate, Ugbowo, Benin City.\\n3. An Order of possession in respect of the land in favor of the Plaintiff.\\n4. A Declaration that any purported claim by way of sales from any person by the defendants is null and void.\\n5. An Order of perpetual injunction restraining the Defendants either by themselves or their servants, and/or agents from dealing with the said land either by building or sales in a manner that is inconsistent with the legal rights&nbsp;and interests of the Plaintiff.\\n6. N5,000,000.00 as general damages for trespass into the land described in (a) above against the Defendants; and\\n7. Any other relief that may be proper in the interest of justice.&nbsp;\\n\\nThe gist of the case of the 1st Respondent as Claimant before the trial Court was that he bought and duly registered the land in dispute in 1972 from his predecessor in title, one Ibhafidon Aburimen, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 8/12/1970 and that he has since 1972 been in undisturbed possession and exercised several acts of ownership, including plotting out the land, conveying portions to several persons without let or hindrance before the unauthorized trespass into the land in dispute by the Appellants.\\n\\u200bOn the other hand, the gist of the case of the Appellants as 1st and 2nd Defendants before the trial Court&nbsp;was that they bought the land in dispute from their predecessor in title, one Ugiagbe Omoragbon, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 10/1/1970 and that they had to settle through the 2nd Respondent with one Miss Iraigonse Okeaya - Inneh, to whom it was alleged that the 1st Respondent had assigned the land in dispute to. They have since developed the land in dispute by building thereon and are in occupation of their house thereon.\\n\\u200bAt the Court below, the parties filed and exchanged their pleadings and the matter proceeded to hearing. At the close of their respective cases, learned counsel for&nbsp;the parties filed and adopted their final written addresses, as well as made oral submissions on the issue of the locus standi of the 1st Respondent to maintain the action against the Respondents.&nbsp;\\nOn 14/4/2011, the trial Court delivered its judgment in which the claims of the 1st Respondent as Claimant against the Appellants as Defendants were granted.&nbsp;\\nBeing dissatisfied with the decision of the trial Court, the Appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal.\\n\",\n          \"This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Katsina State holden at Funtua in Suit No. KTH/FT/135M/10, delivered on 14/2/2011 by Hon. Justice I.M. Bako.\\n\\nThe Respondent commenced an action at the Federal High Court Katsina, against Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye under the undefended list procedure claiming the sum of Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty-Six Thousand, Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50K) being the balance of payment due to the Respondent for carrying out sub-contract work of stone pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Ltd. Judgment was entered in favour of the Respondent and the Appellant being dissatisfied appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal in appeal No. CA/K/201/2008 allowed the appeal in a judgment delivered on 15th December, 2010, on the ground that the Federal High Court, Katsina, lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action; hence the judgment was set aside and the suit struck out. Consequently, the Respondent filed a fresh action before the High Court of Katsina State in Suit No: KTH/FT/135M/2010 under the undefended list procedure.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Respondent obtained the leave of Court to serve the originating processes on the Appellant outside jurisdiction and the bailiff of the trial Court served the writ of summons and accompanying affidavit with the order of the Court granting leave to serve outside jurisdiction (which was obtained ex parte) on the Appellant's secretary, one Miss Ebere Nge of Babington Ashaye &amp; Co. The bailiff of the trial Court filed a proof of service of the originating processes on the Appellant and also delivered the processes to the Appellant's Counsel at his chambers but no step was taken to file any notice of intention to defend the action. On 14th February, 2011, when the matter came up for hearing, the Appellant was absent and unrepresented by Counsel and no notice of intention to defend the action was filed by the Appellant. However, during the course of the proceedings, just when the Court was about pronouncing its judgment, counsel to the Appellant, Mr. O.A. Orewale Esq. arrived in Court very late and the judge refused to record the counsel's appearance. Upon a careful consideration of the Writ, the affidavit in support and Exhibits annexed and the oral submissions of Counsel to the Respondent, the High Court proceeded to enter judgment in favour of the Respondent for the sum of Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and Sixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50k) together with interest at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid. Sequel to the decision of the High Court, the Appellant as judgment debtor filed a motion dated 14th February, 2011, at the High Court praying the Court to set aside its judgment, which the Respondent's Counsel vehemently opposed in a counter affidavit among other issues that the Court had become functus officio and should dismiss the application. After a careful consideration, the High Court dismissed the application for lacking in merit. While the appeal was pending, the initial Appellant, Mr. Babington Ashaye died and the Appellant's Counsel filed an application dated 8th February, 2013, praying for leave to substitute Mr. Babington Ashaye with Mr. Babatunde Ajayi, who is the new Receiver of Stirling Civil Engineering Ltd. The application was granted by this Honourable Court on the 18th of June, 2013, and the notice of appeal was amended and filed accordingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nDissatisfied with the said judgment, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.\",\n          \"This appeal is against the judgment of the Federal High Court sitting in Warri in Suit No. FHC/WR/CS/53/2015 delivered on 5th April 2016, coram Hon.

The appellant claimed to have won the primary election at the end of poll and his name was forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission (1st Respondent) as the candidate of the 2nd respondent (PDP). According to him, his name was substituted with that of Mr. Reuben Izeze, the 3rd respondent. Efforts to get his name restored on the list of contestants who won the primary election of 2nd Respondent (PDP) met a brick wall and hence his suit against the Respondent at the Federal High Court.\\n\\nThe Appellant who was the plaintiff before the Federal High Court filed an originating summons on 9th April, 2015 wherein he claimed against all the Respondents who were defendants before the Federal High Court as follows:\\n\\\"(1) Whether the National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is empowered to conduct primaries and present candidates to the Delta State House of Assembly election scheduled for April 11, 2015 on behalf of the party.\\n(2) Whether the plaintiff having won and was issued the certificate of return as the winner of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency primary election conducted by the National Working Committee of the 2nd defendant can be surreptitiously substituted with the 3rd defendant by the 1st and 2nd defendants as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency elections in total disregard of the report of the 2nd defendant's electoral panel and electoral appeal committee for the conduct of the Delta State House of Assembly primaries held on the 29th day of November, 2014, the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\\\"\\n\\nHe sought for the following reliefs consequent upon the determination of the foregoing questions.\\n\\\"(1) A declaration that the plaintiff having won the received (sic) the certificate of result as the winner of the Ughelli South Constituency, Delta State House of Assembly primaries conducted by the National Working Committee of the 2nd defendant, is the rightful and lawful candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly election slated for the 11th day of April 2015.\\n(2) A declaration that the 1st and 2nd defendants' surreptitious substitution of the plaintiff's name with the 3rd defendant's name as the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly Ughelli South Constituency election slated for the 11th day of April 2015 in total disregard of the result of the primaries, report of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) electoral panel is contrary to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) and the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) and therefore unlawful, illegal and of no effect whatsoever.\\n(3) A declaration that any step taken by the defendant in furtherance of the unlawful substitution of the plaintiff with the 3rd defendant is disregard (sic) of the result of the primaries conducted by the National Working Committee of the PDP, report of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Electoral Panel, the People Democratic Party Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) is a nullity.\\n(4) An order reinstating the name of the plaintiff as the lawful and rightful candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the Delta State House of Assembly, Ughelli South Constituency election slated for the 11th day of April, 2015.\\n(5) An order nullifying the election of the 3rd defendant into the Delta State of Assembly, Ughelli South constituency held on the 11th day of April, 2015.\\n(6) An order nullifying and or setting aside the certificate of return issued by the 1st defendant to the 3rd defendant on the basis of the election held on 11th April 2015 on the ground that the said election amount to a nullity.\\n(7) An order directing the 1st defendant to issue a certificate of return to the plaintiff as the duly elected member of the Delta State House of Assembly representing Ughelli South constituency.\\n(8) An order directing the 3rd defendant to refund all monies, salaries, allowances and or benefits collected and received by him as a member representing Ughelli South constituency in the Delta State House of Assembly from the date (sic) swearing in until judgment is delivered.\\n(9) GENERAL DAMAGES\\nGeneral damages against the defendants jointly and severally in the sum of N500,000,000.00 (five hundred million naira).\\\"\\nRespective counsel after entering conditional appearance on behalf of their client (i.e. 1st, 2nd and 3rd defendants) and joining issues with the Appellant also filed separate motions challenging the competence of the action by the Appellant and the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the suit. Issues were also joined by the Appellant on the 2nd and 3rd Defendants/Respondents notice of preliminary objections. After the adoption of written addresses on the preliminary objection and processes of respective party in the substantive originating summons, the Federal High Court on the 5th day of April 2016 delivered its considered judgment wherein it upheld the preliminary objections by the 2nd and 3rd respondents and struck out the suit of the appellant.&nbsp;Dissatisfied with the said judgment, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

(Delivering the Leading Judgment): This appeal is against the judgment delivered on 6th May, 2019 in the High Court of Bauchi State sitting at Bauchi.\\n\\nIn the High Court (the Court below), the Appellant and two other accused persons were tried and convicted for conspiracy and culpable homicide punishable under Sections 97 and 221 of the Penal Code.\\n\\nThe case of the Respondent against the Appellant as can be made out from the evidence of the five witnesses called by the Respondent is that sometimes in March, 2017 PW2 was engaged by the 1st accused and the Appellant to convey them and the victim on his commercial motorcycle to a certain destination. He did. When they reached a village called Kofar Maza at a particular place the 1st accused person told the PW2 to drop them as there was no passage from there. The PW2 did. He was given five hundred Naira (N500.00) and he returned home\\n\\nThe following day the PW2 heard over the radio that an old man was missing at Fadan Toro. That was the victim. PW2 said that the man was not missing that he was taken to a medicine man by the children. PW2 was advised to report to the\\n1\\n children of the victim. He reported to the children of the victim. The children said they should go to the police station and report. They did. The police stepped into the matter. This led to the arrest of the 1st accused person and the Appellant and the subsequent recovery of the remains of the victim with some parts of the body of the victim including the head, eyes and penis removed and or cut off.\\n\\nIn his defence, the Appellant denied the charge against him. He said he was arrested and taken to Toro Police Station from where he was taken to Criminal Investigation Department Bauchi where he was accused of Culpable Homicide. He told the police that he did not know anything. He told the police that he did not know the other accused persons.\\n\\nThe Court below considered the Respondent\\u2019s evidence as well as the defence of the Appellant and addresses of counsel. It found the Appellant and the other accused persons guilty. They were convicted and sentenced to death. The Appellant has proceeded to this Court on appeal by a Notice of Appeal filed on 5th October, 2019. The Notice of Appeal contains six grounds of appeal. From the six grounds of appeal\\n\\n2\\n the Appellant in an Appellant\\u2019s brief filed on 2nd November, 2021 presented the following four issues for determination:\\n1. Whether or not the trial Court was right when it refused to consider the existence of another statements (sic) made by the Appellant before Toro Divisional Office and the prosecution (sic) failure to tender same? (distilled from ground 1 of the Notice and Grounds of Appeal).\\n2. Whether or not MURTALA USMAN and LAWAL MACHANIC are vital witness (sic) and the prosecution (sic) failure to call them is fatal to his case same can justify the setting aside of the trial Court (sic) decision? (Distilled from Grounds 2 of the Notice and Grounds of Appeal).\\n3. Whether or not the trial Court was right when it shifted the burden of prove (sic) to the appellant? (Distilled from Grounds (sic) 5 of the Notice and Grounds of Appeal).\\n4. Whether or not the entire trial Court (sic) decision is against the weight of the evidence? (Distilled from Grounds 3, 4 and 6 of the Notice and Grounds of Appeal.\\n\\nThe Respondent in a respondent\\u2019s brief of argument filed on 19th January, 2022 and deemed duly filed and served the same\\n\\n3\\ndate adopted the four issues formulated by the Appellant.\\n\\nArguing issue 1, learned counsel for the Appellant contended that the failure of the Respondent to produce the statements of the Appellant made at the Toro Divisional Office was intentional and intended to divert the course of justice. The intention, it was further argued was that the statements would favour the Appellant. The Court was referred to evidence of PW1 and PW4 that statements of the Appellant and the other accused persons were recorded at the Toro Police Station. It was contended that failure to tender the statements made at Toro Police Station was fatal to the case of the Respondent as the Respondent could not pick and choose any aspect of its case in its favour and refuse to tender the one that is expected to be favourable to the Appellant. Failure to tender the statement made at the Police Station Toro was a ploy to ensure the conviction of the Appellant, it was argued.\\n\\u200b\\nIt was submitted that the law is clear that where there exists more than one statement of the accused person in criminal trials, all must be tendered not for anything but to ensure justice on all the parties. \",\n          \"Between:\\nMR.

Justice O.I. Odion.\\n\\nThe Appellant, one of the sons of the deceased Chief Boniface Omofoma, challenged the grant of probate to the Respondent, the widow and executrix named in the 2019 Will of the deceased. He sought an order revoking probate on the grounds that the Will was procured under undue influence, and that the deceased lacked testamentary capacity at the time of execution due to deteriorating health.\\n\\nThe trial court dismissed the challenge, finding the Will valid, properly executed, and the deceased mentally competent. The Appellant filed this appeal.\\n\\nGrounds of Appeal\\nThat the trial judge erred in upholding the validity of the Will despite evidence suggesting the testator suffered cognitive decline.\\n\\nThat the learned trial judge wrongly placed the burden of proving undue influence on the Appellant.\\n\\nThat the court failed to evaluate the suspicious circumstances surrounding the preparation of the Will.\\n\\nBriefs and Issues for Determination\\nAppellant\\u2019s Brief:\\nFiled on 22/09/2022 by C.J.

The court must also be satisfied that the Will was not procured by coercion or undue influence.\\n\\nIn this case:\\n\\nThe Will was executed in the presence of two attesting witnesses;\\n\\nThe medical certificate presented by the Respondent showed that the deceased was lucid and of full capacity as of March 2019;\\n\\nThe Appellant failed to rebut this with expert evidence but relied on anecdotal testimony from family members.\\n\\nThe court correctly placed the burden on the Appellant to prove undue influence once the Will was shown to be formally valid. See Okelola v. Boyle (1998) 2 NWLR (Pt. 539) 533.\\n\\nSuspicion alone, especially where the testator appointed a spouse as executrix, does not displace the presumption of due execution. See Johnson v. Maja (1951) 13 WACA 290.\\n\\nAllegation of Breach of Fair Hearing\\nThe Appellant alleged he was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the notary who supervised the execution of the Will. However, the record shows that he was absent on the day the witness testified and did not apply to recall him. There was no denial of fair hearing.\\n\\nBurden of Proof and Legal Evaluation\\nThe Respondent successfully established:\\n\\nDue execution of the Will;\\n\\nPresence of witnesses;\\n\\nMedical evidence of mental competence.\\n\\nThe Appellant failed to establish any coercion, duress, or evidence that the deceased was not acting voluntarily.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe appeal lacks merit.\\n\\nThe judgment of the Edo State High Court in Suit No. B/PROB/72/2021 is affirmed. The Will dated 4th March 2019 is declared valid, and the grant of probate to the Respondent stands.\\n\\nJUSTICE SHAMSUDDEEN M. ALKALI, J.C.A.:\\nI agree. Probate law guards against speculation. Proof, not suspicion, determines capacity.\\n\\nJUSTICE CHIBUZOR N. ORJI, J.C.A.:\\nI concur. The burden to displace a duly executed Will is high and was not met here.\\n\\nAppearances:\\nC.J. EBEWELE, Esq. (with T.A. Osifo, Esq.) \\u2013 For the Appellant\\nR.O. OYEDIRAN, Esq. (with E. Ighodalo, Esq.) \\u2013 For the Respondent\",\n          \"VICTOR&nbsp;AIMEPOMO&nbsp;OYELEYE&nbsp;OMAGE, J.C.A. (Delivering the Leading Judgment): This appeal is against the judgment of the Local Government Election Tribunal Sokoto State. The judgment was delivered on 20th day of January, 1999 and the petition of the appellant was dismissed.\\n\\nThe appellant being dissatisfied has filed this appeal against the judgment. The appellant has submitted two issues for determination these are:-\\n(a) Whether or not the contents of Exhibit A constitute an indictment. (Exhibit A is a copy of the report of inquiry into Hajj operations). These are:-\\n(b) Whether or not the petitioner appellant proved his case in totality of the evidence.\\n\\nThe appeal was filed in the lower Tribunal on 25/1/99, and by provision of the law the appeal should be disposed off within 30 days. On 14th February when the brief of argument of appellant was brought before this Court no evidence of proof of service of the appeal on the respondent was shown. It became imperative to consider the appeal today 24/2/99 to facilitate the determination of the appeal on 25/2/99 when the appeal will lapse. The three grounds of appeal filed are contained in the issues formulated for\\n1\\n determination as above; the implication being that the answers given to the issues formulated will determine whether or not as averred by the appellant the 1st respondent was electable at the time of the election on 5th December, 1998.\\n \\nThe exhibits tendered at the lower Court are vital to the determination of the issues formulated by the applicant these consist of Exhibits A of our folios and Exhibit B with two annexures. Exhibit A is the photocopy of the report of Gwadabawa Local Government. It recorded as twenty four the number of witnesses at the enquiry, and averred that of the over fourteen million naira collected by officials of the Hajj operation, deposit for flight to Hajj the sum of over four million \\\"was not paid into Hajj account, but was used by the Local Government Council and Registration Officer for other purposes\\\". In the report the 1st respondent was described as a guide the report specifically showed that the Hajj seats were allocated by the chairman and his boys and the implication is apparent that 1st respondent was among the boys who sold Hajj seats indiscriminately.\\n \\nThe report recommended that the 1st respondent should be\\n\\n2\\n disqualified and blacklisted for appointment as a guide. The 1st annexure to Exhibit B, marked C. I sent by the council to the 1st respondent dated 7th December, 1995 used the following word in addressing the 1st respondent. \\\"You are one of those found wanting by judicial board of enquiry you are henceforth relieved of your post Hajj Registration Officer and disqualified from performing duty as Hajj registration officer in any Local Government Area in Sokoto State.\\\" It was sent from the office of the State Attorney General to the 1st respondent and it is dated 10th December, 1996. It stated in material particular as follows:-\\n \\\"The report only recommended that you be precluded from acting as guide to pilgrims from Gwadabawa Local Government Area your testimony before the judicial panel of enquiry does not per-se incriminate you for any indictable offence.\\\" etc.\\n \\nPronouncing on the two exhibits the learned trial Judges in the lower Tribunal in their judgment delivered on 20th January, 1998 recorded as follows:\\n \\\"There is nothing in Exhibit A indicating that the 1st respondent was indicted by a judicial commission of inquiry. We fully agreed ... that\\n\\n3\\n Exhibit B should be read as a whole, there is therefore no evidence supporting the averment of the petitioner.\\\"\\n \\nThe net result is that the petitioner has not proved the averments contained in part 3(VI) of the petition. The issues formulated by appellant in (a) above is that the lower Tribunal erred in holding that Exhibit A did not constitute a crime against the 1st respondent or as it was put whether or not the contents of Exhibit A above constitute an indictment. An indictment is the result of a finding of guilt of a committal of crime. A person who has not committed a crime is not indicted. In order to show that Exhibit A inpute an indictment it must be shown that a crime has been committed. In this case it must be shown that the 1st respondent has committed a crime. It is our law that the proof of a crime must be made beyond reasonable doubt: even in an election matter the crime alleged must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. See Nwobodo v. Onoh (1984) 1 SCNLR 1; (1983) FNELR 174 at 175 decision No. See also Akin Omoboriowo v. Michael Ajasin\\n\\n4\\n (1984) 1 SCNLR 108; (1983) 1 FNLR 236 where it was held that allegation of crime in an election Tribunal must be proved beyond reasonable doubt as in Section 137 Evidence Act. The statement contained in Exhibit A before the lower Court merely reprimanded the 1st respondent, Exhibit B there showed clearly that no indictment is conveyed in the said Exhibit A which derived from the board of inquiry in which 1st respondent testified. There is therefore no evidence on which allegation of crime is made which may result in indictment of the 1st respondent. In the face of Exhibit B the lower Court need to do no more. The Court is not an investigative body. See Muhammed Duriminiya v. C.O.P. (1961 )NNLR 70 at 73/74. Exhibit A does not constitute an indictment of 1st respondent.\\nThe answer to the second issue as to whether the appellant has proved his case in totality of evidence is contained above. To establish that Exhibit A constitutes an indictment of 1st respondent the petitioner has to do more than rely on Exhibit A alone. He has to show the prosecution of 1st respondent which is the indictment. There is no evidence of the prosecution of the 1st\\n\\n5\\n respondent and he was not indicted. The petitioner has failed to prove any case against the 1st respondent, and in any allegation of crime against 1st respondent he needs to make a proof beyond reasonable doubt. See Section 137 Evidence Act, supra. \\n \\nThe totality of evidence tendered at the lower Tribunal is less than adequate.&nbsp;The petitioner has failed therefore to prove his complaint his appeal must fail. It fails, it is dismissed.\\n\\nRABIU&nbsp;DANLAMI&nbsp;MUHAMMAD, J.C.A.: I have read before now the judgment of my learned brother Omage JCA, just delivered. He has thoroughly dealt with all the issues involved in this appeal. I agree with his reasonings and conclusion. I too would dismiss the appeal because it lacks merit.\\n \\nIBRAHIM&nbsp;TANKO&nbsp;MUHAMMAD, J.C.A.: I have had the opportunity of reading in advance the judgment just delivered by my learned brother Omage, JCA.

N5,000,000.00 as general damages for trespass into the land described in (a) above against the Defendants; and\\n7. Any other relief that may be proper in the interest of justice.&nbsp;\\n\\nThe gist of the case of the 1st Respondent as Claimant before the trial Court was that he bought and duly registered the land in dispute in 1972 from his predecessor in title, one Ibhafidon Aburimen, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 8/12/1970 and that he has since 1972 been in undisturbed possession and exercised several acts of ownership, including plotting out the land, conveying portions to several persons without let or hindrance before the unauthorized trespass into the land in dispute by the Appellants.\\n\\u200bOn the other hand, the gist of the case of the Appellants as 1st and 2nd Defendants before the trial Court&nbsp;was that they bought the land in dispute from their predecessor in title, one Ugiagbe Omoragbon, who had earlier got a grant of the said land from the Oba of Benin, whose approval was granted on 10/1/1970 and that they had to settle through the 2nd Respondent with one Miss Iraigonse Okeaya - Inneh, to whom it was alleged that the 1st Respondent had assigned the land in dispute to.

Whether the Court below was right when it held that the 1st Respondent had proved his title to the land in dispute? \\n2. Whether the 1st Respondent had proved that the land in dispute over which the Court below granted him a declaration of title actually measured 928.067 square meters? \\n3. Whether the Court below was right when it held that the Appellants failed to join issues with the 1st Respondent on the averments raised in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Statement of Claim and as a result held that the Appellants must be deemed to have admitted those averments?\\n4.

Justice I.M. Bako.\\n\\nThe Respondent commenced an action at the Federal High Court Katsina, against Mr. Ade A. Babington Ashaye under the undefended list procedure claiming the sum of Twenty Two Million, Four Hundred and Sixty-Six Thousand, Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50K) being the balance of payment due to the Respondent for carrying out sub-contract work of stone pitching of water drainage in Funtua town of Katsina State for Stirling Civil Engineering Nigeria Ltd. Judgment was entered in favour of the Respondent and the Appellant being dissatisfied appealed to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal in appeal No. CA/K/201/2008 allowed the appeal in a judgment delivered on 15th December, 2010, on the ground that the Federal High Court, Katsina, lacked jurisdiction to entertain the action; hence the judgment was set aside and the suit struck out. Consequently, the Respondent filed a fresh action before the High Court of Katsina State in Suit No: KTH/FT/135M/2010 under the undefended list procedure.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Respondent obtained the leave of Court to serve the originating processes on the Appellant outside jurisdiction and the bailiff of the trial Court served the writ of summons and accompanying affidavit with the order of the Court granting leave to serve outside jurisdiction (which was obtained ex parte) on the Appellant's secretary, one Miss Ebere Nge of Babington Ashaye &amp; Co. The bailiff of the trial Court filed a proof of service of the originating processes on the Appellant and also delivered the processes to the Appellant's Counsel at his chambers but no step was taken to file any notice of intention to defend the action. On 14th February, 2011, when the matter came up for hearing, the Appellant was absent and unrepresented by Counsel and no notice of intention to defend the action was filed by the Appellant. However, during the course of the proceedings, just when the Court was about pronouncing its judgment, counsel to the Appellant, Mr. O.A. Orewale Esq. arrived in Court very late and the judge refused to record the counsel's appearance. Upon a careful consideration of the Writ, the affidavit in support and Exhibits annexed and the oral submissions of Counsel to the Respondent, the High Court proceeded to enter judgment in favour of the Respondent for the sum of Twenty Two Million Four Hundred and Sixty Six Thousand Two Hundred Naira and Fifty Kobo (N22,466,200.50k) together with interest at the rate of 21% per annum until the entire judgment sum is paid. Sequel to the decision of the High Court, the Appellant as judgment debtor filed a motion dated 14th February, 2011, at the High Court praying the Court to set aside its judgment, which the Respondent's Counsel vehemently opposed in a counter affidavit among other issues that the Court had become functus officio and should dismiss the application. After a careful consideration, the High Court dismissed the application for lacking in merit. While the appeal was pending, the initial Appellant, Mr. Babington Ashaye died and the Appellant's Counsel filed an application dated 8th February, 2013, praying for leave to substitute Mr. Babington Ashaye with Mr. Babatunde Ajayi, who is the new Receiver of Stirling Civil Engineering Ltd. The application was granted by this Honourable Court on the 18th of June, 2013, and the notice of appeal was amended and filed accordingly.\\n\\n\\n\\nDissatisfied with the said judgment, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.

The appellant claimed to have won the primary election at the end of poll and his name was forwarded to the Independent National Electoral Commission (1st Respondent) as the candidate of the 2nd respondent (PDP). According to him, his name was substituted with that of Mr. Reuben Izeze, the 3rd respondent.

DANIEL-KALIO, J.C.A. (Delivering the Leading Judgment): This appeal is in respect of a land sale agreement. The 1st Respondent, Alhaji Aliko Mohammed OFR was the claimant at the High Court of Kaduna State. He had four plots of land at Angwan Gwari, directly behind the premises of Sterling Civil Engineering Company Ltd. The 1st Respondent decided to dispose of the four plots in order to raise additional funds for a bottled water project he was embarking on at Misau, Bauchi State. He therefore authorized the 2nd Respondent, a friend of over 40 years, to get a buyer for the four plots. He laid out his terms and conditions for selling the plots. This included a selling price of N18 million for the four plots. Soon enough, the 2nd Respondent informed the 1st Respondent that he had found a willing buyer who was prepared to pay the offered price of N18 million. The prospective buyer, the 2nd Respondent informed the 1st Respondent, that he was offering to pay a deposit of N3 million and pay the balance of N15 million within three weeks. The 1st Respondent agreed. The prospective buyer was unknown to the 1st Respondent. The deposit of N3\\n\\n1\\n million was paid, but of that sum, the 1st Respondent paid 2nd Respondent the agreed Commission of 5% amounting to the sum of N900,000.00. The expected balance of N15 million was however not paid within the promised period of 3 weeks. Instead, payments were made piece meal. Dissatisfied with that, the 1st Respondent withdrew from the sale transaction. In the meantime, the 2nd Respondent had released the 1st Respondent's Certificate of Occupancy to the Appellant, the man who offered to buy the plots of land. The Appellant subdivided the plots and sold them to the 4th - 12th Respondents. Unhappy about this turn of events, the 1st Respondent expressed his disappointment to the 2nd Respondent and refunded the sum of N12 million he had so far received. He also demanded by a letter of his Solicitors, the return of his Certificates of Occupancy and payment of damages for trespass. The Appellant's Solicitor replied the letter and insisted that the Appellant had acquired title to the plots of land. Consequently, the 1st Respondent filed a suit against the parties and claimed as follows:-\\n\\\"(a) A DECLARATION that the plaintiff is the lawful owner/holder of the Right\\n\\n2\\n of Occupancy over the 4 plots of land situate at Angwan Gwari, directly behind Sterling Civil Engineering Company Limited, premises, Mando, Kaduna, respectively covered by Certificate of Occupancy Nos.

AN ORDER setting aside all planning permission or development approvals given by the 13th defendant to the 4th - 12th Defendants in respect of the plots illegally carved out of the plaintiff's 4 plots.\\n(n) AN ORDER of perpetual injunction restraining the Defendants, either by themselves or through their servants, agents, privies, Proxies or howsoever from\\n\\n5\\n further entering into the plaintiff's said Plots.\\\"\\n\\nThe 3rd to 12th Respondents in the appeal who were the 3rd to 12th defendants in the lower Court, filed a joint Statement of Defence wherein they denied the 1st Respondents claims. The Appellant who was the 2nd defendant at the lower Court filed a Statement of Defence and Counter-Claim. After hearing the parties, the lower Court came to the conclusion that the transaction between the 1st defendant and the 2nd defendant, that is, the 2nd Respondent and the Appellant in this appeal, was not valid as there was no consensus ad idem between the buyer and the seller of the plots of land. The Court also held that the conditions in Exhibit 4 before it were not fulfilled by the 2nd defendant i.e. the Appellant here. The Court also held that the Appellant had failed to prove his counter-claim. Consequently, all the claims of the 1st Respondent were granted. The judgment was delivered on 27/5/15.\\n\\nDissatisfied with the judgment, the Appellant by a Notice of Appeal dated 14/7/15 and filed on even date, challenged the judgment on 4 grounds. The grounds without the particulars of the grounds are as follows:-\",\n          \"Between:\\nMR. KENNETH OMOFOMA \\u2013 Appellant\\nAND\\nMRS. ROSE OMOFOMA (as Executrix of the Estate of Chief Boniface Omofoma) \\u2013 Respondent\\n\\nIntroduction\\nThis appeal arises from the judgment of the Edo State High Court, Probate Division, delivered on 4th August, 2022 in Suit No. B/PROB/72/2021 by Hon. Justice O.I. Odion.\\n\\nThe Appellant, one of the sons of the deceased Chief Boniface Omofoma, challenged the grant of probate to the Respondent, the widow and executrix named in the 2019 Will of the deceased. He sought an order revoking probate on the grounds that the Will was procured under undue influence, and that the deceased lacked testamentary capacity at the time of execution due to deteriorating health.\\n\\nThe trial court dismissed the challenge, finding the Will valid, properly executed, and the deceased mentally competent. The Appellant filed this appeal.\\n\\nGrounds of Appeal\\nThat the trial judge erred in upholding the validity of the Will despite evidence suggesting the testator suffered cognitive decline.\\n\\nThat the learned trial judge wrongly placed the burden of proving undue influence on the Appellant.\\n\\nThat the court failed to evaluate the suspicious circumstances surrounding the preparation of the Will.\\n\\nBriefs and Issues for Determination\\nAppellant\\u2019s Brief:\\nFiled on 22/09/2022 by C.J. Ebewele, Esq., raising two issues:\\n\\nWhether the Will of late Chief Boniface Omofoma was validly executed with full testamentary capacity.\\n\\nWhether the surrounding circumstances gave rise to a presumption of undue influence.\\n\\nRespondent\\u2019s Brief:\\nFiled on 05/10/2022 by R.O. Oyediran, Esq., raising a single issue:\\n\\n\\u201cWhether the Will of the deceased was validly executed in accordance with the Wills Law and whether the trial court properly evaluated the evidence.\\u201d\\n\\nResolution of the Appeal\\nUnder Section 7 of the Wills Law (Cap. 172, Laws of Bendel State, applicable in Edo State), a testator must be of sound disposing mind, memory, and understanding at the time of making the Will. The court must also be satisfied that the Will was not procured by coercion or undue influence.\\n\\nIn this case:\\n\\nThe Will was executed in the presence of two attesting witnesses;\\n\\nThe medical certificate presented by the Respondent showed that the deceased was lucid and of full capacity as of March 2019;\\n\\nThe Appellant failed to rebut this with expert evidence but relied on anecdotal testimony from family members.\\n\\nThe court correctly placed the burden on the Appellant to prove undue influence once the Will was shown to be formally valid. See Okelola v. Boyle (1998) 2 NWLR (Pt. 539) 533.\\n\\nSuspicion alone, especially where the testator appointed a spouse as executrix, does not displace the presumption of due execution. See Johnson v. Maja (1951) 13 WACA 290.\\n\\nAllegation of Breach of Fair Hearing\\nThe Appellant alleged he was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the notary who supervised the execution of the Will. However, the record shows that he was absent on the day the witness testified and did not apply to recall him. There was no denial of fair hearing.\\n\\nBurden of Proof and Legal Evaluation\\nThe Respondent successfully established:\\n\\nDue execution of the Will;\\n\\nPresence of witnesses;\\n\\nMedical evidence of mental competence.\\n\\nThe Appellant failed to establish any coercion, duress, or evidence that the deceased was not acting voluntarily.\\n\\nConclusion\\nThe appeal lacks merit.\\n\\nThe judgment of the Edo State High Court in Suit No. B/PROB/72/2021 is affirmed. The Will dated 4th March 2019 is declared valid, and the grant of probate to the Respondent stands.\\n\\nJUSTICE SHAMSUDDEEN M. ALKALI, J.C.A.:\\nI agree. Probate law guards against speculation. Proof, not suspicion, determines capacity.\\n\\nJUSTICE CHIBUZOR N. ORJI, J.C.A.:\\nI concur. The burden to displace a duly executed Will is high and was not met here.\\n\\nAppearances:\\nC.J. EBEWELE, Esq. (with T.A. Osifo, Esq.) \\u2013 For the Appellant\\nR.O. OYEDIRAN, Esq. (with E. Ighodalo, Esq.) \\u2013 For the Respondent\",\n          \"MOHAMMED MUSTAPHA, J.C.A. (Delivering the Leading Judgment): This is an appeal against the judgment of the Kogi State High Court of the 28th day of November, 2011, presided by Hon. Justice H.A. Olusiyi, wherein judgement was entered for the respondent in the sum of N1,084,000 for special and general damages.\\n\\nFour witnesses testified for the claimant/respondent, and one witness for the defendant/appellant.\\n\\nFrom the Notice of Appeal filed on the 16th January 2014 two grounds of appeal were filed, from which three issues were formulated for determination by the appellant; the issues are:\\n1. Is the representation of the claimant/respondent by the Nigeria Legal AID Council Lokoja competent to warrant the trial Court to assume jurisdiction in the matter?\\n2. Was the cross examination of the claimant/respondent by the counsel to the appellant properly evaluated by the honourable Court in respect to the controversion of facts in pleadings?\\n3. Was the reliance of the Court on the Exhibit C15-18 to have lent credence to the evidence of Cw1/respondent that his vehicle was badly damaged and that he carried out repairs on it only proper in law to\\n1\\n have reached a conclusion for award of specific damage?\\n\\nON ISSUE ONE: It is submitted for the appellant that all Court processes show that the respondent who is a public servant was represented by the Legal Aid Council as per pages 206 and 214 of the records.\\n\\nThat during cross examination the respondent admitted to being a Chief Administrative officer on salary Grade Level 14, with more than one car, but had the authority of the board of the council to be represented.\\n\\nLearned counsel submitted that the Legal Aid Act 2011 promulgated for representation of only indigent members of the society; learned counsel referred this Court to the explanatory Notes of the Act, Section 10(1), (2) and (3) of the Act. \\n\\nThat even though the respondent claimed he had the authority of the board to be represented no such authority was annexed to the originating summons, nor tendered during the trial.\\n\\nThat since the provision is a statutory one that makes the matter an issue of jurisdiction, there being no authority of the board before the trial Court.\\n\\nThat the issue of non payment of filing fees rendered the proceedings a nullity notwithstanding the\\n\\n   2 \\nfinding of the trial Court at pages 308 to 309 that the necessary requirement of Section 10 (1)(2)(3) and 5 were met; learned counsel referred this Court to MADUKOLU V. NKEMDILIM (1962) S.C. 172, MADAYEDUPIN V. OLANINORAN (2013) NWLR part 1334 at 204 and CBN V. AUTO IMPORT EXPORT (2013) 2 NWLR part 1337 at 132 and contended that this matter was not initiated by due process of the law.\\n\\nThat no Court is allowed to confer jurisdiction on itself where no such jurisdiction exists; he referred this Court to ODIASE V. AGHO (1972) 1 All NLR part 1 at 170, and OLUTOLA V. UNIVERSITY OF ILORIN (2004) NSCQR Page 259.\\n\\nLearned counsel contends there is nothing before the Court to show that the claimant/respondent had the authority or approval of the Board of Legal Aid Council to be represented.\\n\\nThat also payment of filling fees is a mandatory requirement, not discretionary, he referred this Court to FADA V. NAOMI (2002) 4 NWLR part 757 at 318.\\n\\nThat also the respondent ought to pay default fees for late amendment of process, on which the trial Court deferred its ruling, as that did not fall into the category of fees payable under Order 55 Rule 8 (1) and\\n3\\n (2).\\n\\nON ISSUE TWO: it is submitted for the appellant that the trial Court failed to consider or evaluate evidence elicited during cross examination; e.g. that in the statement on oath at page 206 to 213 of the record the claimant/respondent stated \\\"...at a bend, he suddenly saw a trailer...\\\"; while in Paragraph 27(vi) and 28 (vi) of the amended statement of claim he stated \\\"...the place where the accident occurred is an express way and close to a bend...\\\"; and during cross examination the claimant/respondent stated the accident happened \\\"...after a bend...\\\"; learned counsel referred this Court to page 263 of the record and 277 also of the record and submitted that the contradiction is material; he referred the Court to ABUBAKAR V. JOSEPH (2008) 1 160 LRCN at 170.\\n\\nThat no reason was given by the trial Court for accepting or believing that the accident happened at a bend; that it is not enough merely to say \\\"I believe\\\"; he referred the Court to ATANDA V. AJANI (1989) 3 NWLR part 111 at 511 and OLADEHIN V. CONTINENTAL TEXTILE MILLS LTD (1978) 2 S.C 23 at 32,\\n\\nLearned counsel submitted while referring to ALAO V. ADIGUN (2009) 12 WRRN at\\n\\n4\\n 101 that a trial judge must weigh the testimonies of witnesses and consider their integrity and veracity.\\n\\n That the contradiction of the alleged accident by the account of eye witnesses elicited during cross examination was not evaluated by the trial Court.\\n\\nEven though the respondent averred in Paragraph 28 (v) of his amended statement of claim and 27(v) of witness' statement on oath that \\\"...the 1st defendant and his conductor did not do this but instead removed the tyre and ran away after the accident\\\"; meaning that there were witnesses to the accident, during cross examination he contradicted his pleadings that only the passengers in his vehicle witnessed the accident, as per page 263 and 290 of the record.\\n\\nThat all the witnesses called by the respondent were not eye witnesses to the accident, and so no witness corroborated why and how the respondent's vehicle somersaulted; and also that neither the police nor Vehicle Inspection Officer, VIO that investigated the matter was called as witnesses.\\n\\nThat also if the record of proceedings of the Magistrate Court where the 1st defendant was discharged and acquitted of causing obstruction cannot be\\n\\n5\\n admitted in evidence nothing stops the trial Court from considering the information, facts and contradictions elicited at the criminal trial from being evaluated.\\n\\nLearned counsel also submitted that the contradictions on the date the sketch map was drawn i.e. 14th December, 2009, and the date the accident happened was not evaluated; the police station from which Exhibit C19 emanated was not stated and that both vehicles were not on the scene when the sketch was drawn; that all these information are from the criminal trial but the contradiction was not weighed. \\n\\nThat also the plaintiff respondent did not prove the ingredients of negligence before the trial Court, because negligence is not proved merely because evidence is not contradicted; he referred the Court to NRW IND. LTD V. AKINGBUGBE (2011) 11 NWLR part 1257 at 137.\\n\\nLearned counsel urged the Court to resolve this issue in favour of the appellant because the evidence in the respondent's pleadings was contradicted and so negligence could not have been proved.\\n\\nON ISSUE THREE: learned counsel submitted that apart from the respondent saying that his vehicle somersaulted there was no\\n\\n6\\n analysis on the nature of the damage to his car or the pre accident condition of the car.\\n\\nThat there was no professional assessment of the alleged damaged car and the vehicle inspection officer was not called to testify, and so merely relying on the receipts of repairs is not enough, learned counsel contended; he referred the Court to ABUBAKAR V. JOSEPH (2008) VOL.160 LRCN at 170 and urged this Court to allow the appeal.\\n\\nTunde Ikusagba Esq., learned counsel for the respondent adopted the issues formulated for determination by the appellant and submitted on issue one that in accordance with Section 10(2) of the Legal Aid Act 2011, Legal Aid may be extended to a person whose income is above the national minimum wage by the approval of the Board of the Legal Aid Council; that such approval does not have to be annexed to the process and tendered as exhibit, because the Act does not specify that the approval should be in writing, as it is an internal arrangement of the council.\\n\\nThat also the respondent's ownership of more than one car or being on Grade Level 14 is immaterial as Section 11(2) of the Act makes the commitments of a person also a\\n\\n7\\n factor in determining his means with regard to whether or not he is an indigent person; this means assessment also is an internal arrangement of the council.\\n\\nThat also the failure of the respondent to pay filing fees did not render the proceedings a nullity because Council is exempted from payment of fees.\\n\\nThat also even if the respondent was not properly represented the appellant has not shown that he was prejudiced by the representation, to have rendered the proceedings a nullity.\\n\\nLearned counsel urged this Court to resolve the issue in his favour.\\n\\nON ISSUE TWO: it is submitted for the respondent that the pleadings of the respondent to the effect that the trailer was negligently parked with its tyre in the other side of the road at 7.30 pm is supported by evidence of Cw1 and was not controverted or challenged; learned counsel referred the Court to NIGERIAN MARITIME SERVICES LTD V. AFOLABI (1978) 2 SC. 79 and FAGBENRO V AROBADI (2006) 7 NWLR part 978 at 172.\\n\\nThat the unchallenged fact that the respondent had an accident in which his car was badly damaged and sustained injuries, means duty of care has been breached, irrespective of\\n\\n8\\n whether the accident occurred at a bend or close to one.\\n\\nThat facts showing appellant's carelessness were pleaded, and the onus as a result shifted to the appellant to disprove negligence; he referred the Court to ARMEL TRANSPORT LTD V OGUGUA (1974) 1 NMLR 357 at 360.\\n\\nThat also the trial Court properly evaluated the evidence of proceedings in the criminal trial at the Magistrate's Court; and that the trial Court did not rely on Exhibit C19, the sketch map, in its judgment as it formed part of the criminal trial.\\n\\nON ISSUE THREE; it is submitted for the respondent that the contention that the respondent did not give detailed and specific facts of the allegedly damaged vehicle s untrue because the respondent tendered Exhibit C15 to C18 which were receipts of repairs as per page 310 of the record.\\n\\nThat also damages are pecuniary compensation awarded for loss or injury suffered whether to person or property through the unlawful act or omission of another; he referred the Court to USAMAN V. OWOEYE (2003) FWLR part 152 at 51 and ADEKUNLE V. ROCKVIEW HOTEL LTD (2004) FWLR part 188 at 1047.\\n\\nLearned counsel urged this Court to dismiss this appeal\\n\\n9\\n for lack of merit.\\n\\nThis appeal will be determined on the issues as formulated by the appellant and adopted by the respondent, with slight reframing for the purpose of clarity.\\nISSUE ONE: Whether the Legal Aid Act, 2011 was complied with in representing the respondent, if not, was the trial Court robbed of jurisdiction as a result?\\n\\nIt is not in dispute that the respondent was a public servant, as per pages 206 and 214 of the record of proceedings; and by the respondent's own admission he works with the Legal Aid Council, as a Chief Administrative Officer on Grade Level 14, as per page 262 of the record of proceedings; and also that he obtained the authority of the board to be represented by counsel, see page 276 of the record of proceedings.\\n\\nThe Legal Aid Act, 2011 by its title is meant to be a \\\"Scheme for the grant of Legal Aid and access to justice in certain matters or proceedings to persons with inadequate resources...\\\"\\nThe Act specified person to who aid applies in Section 10(1), (2) and (3);\\n(1) Legal aid shall be granted to a person whose income does not exceed the national minimum wage.\\n(2) Notwithstanding\\n\\n10\\nthe provisions of (1) the Board may in exceptional circumstances grant legal aid services to a person whose earning exceeds the national minimum wage,\\n(3) notwithstanding the provisions of Section (1), the governing board may approve the giving of legal aid on a contributory basis to a person ten times the national minimum wage...\\\"\\nThe respondent's claim to entitlement for aid is hinged in this case only on the approval he obtained from the board, which the trial accord accepted when it held:\\n\\\"...there is nothing before me to show the contrary, I therefore take it that the claimant is a beneficiary of legal aid as provided for by the provisions of Section 10 (1), (2), (3) and (5) of the Legal Aid Act, 2011, and is therefore exempted from payment of Court fees.\\\"\\nOn a careful examination of the record of proceedings this Court fails to see the basis upon which the trial Court arrived at this conclusion, apart from the statement of the respondent during cross examination that he was granted Board Approval; clearly all the trial Court had to rely on in this regard is the ipse dixit of the respondent. That is simply not enough in the\\n11\\n circumstances.\\nThe Legal Aid Act specifically provided for those entitled to aid in Section 10; if the respondent were indeed qualified as he claimed, then the burden is on him to establish what entitled him to legal aid representation.\\n\\\"Burden of proof is the duty to offer evidence in proof of a party's assertions of counter-assertions, and evidence is the means whereby a Court is informed as to the issue of facts as ascertained by the pleading, that is, the testimony - oral, documentary or real, which may be legally received in order to prove or disprove some facts in dispute.\\\"\\nAKINTOLA v. SOLANO (1986) 4 SC 141.\\nWhoever desires any Court to give judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts must prove that those facts exist. The burden of proof of the assertion is on the person who asserts. In this case the respondent, see DALHATU v. ATTORNEY-GENERAL, KATSINA STATE (2008) All FWLR (Pt.405) 1651 at 1677.\\nThe burden of proof ought to have been discharged in this case by producing the minutes of meeting that gave the approval for representation to the respondent, or any letter or\\n\\n12\\n note from the said board; the contention that no such letter is necessary cannot hold; especially when account is taken of the fact that it is the appellant who claimed to have obtained such approval.\\nThe provision for representation by the Legal Aid Act is a statutory one, and that in essence makes the matter in this case that of competence before the trial Court, as a precursor to jurisdiction; and the absence of authority on the part of the respondent robs the trial Court of jurisdiction effectively.\\n\\nJurisdiction of a Court is not separable from its competence to adjudicate on a matter because a Court or tribunal has to be:\\na) Properly constituted in terms of number and qualification of its members.\\nb) The subject matter of the action must be within the jurisdiction of the Court, in the sense that it has competence to adjudicate over it, and most importantly in this case;\\nc) The matter is initiated by due process of law with nothing to rob the Court of its jurisdiction, see MADUKOLU V. NKEMDILIM (1962) 172.\\nThe power or authority to embark upon trial or determination of a matter is donated by the Constitution or the statute\\n\\n13\\n as the case may be. Jurisdiction is very pivotal in any cause or matter, be it civil or criminal.\\nSee case of ALHAJI GARBA ABBAS &amp; ANOR COP KANO STATE (1998) 12 NWLR per MOHAMMAD JCA. (pt.577) 304 at 316 B - D and CHIEF DANIEL ANOBELE OLOBA V. OLUBODUN AKEREJA (1988) (PT. 84) 508 AT 520 PER OBASEKI JSC where it was held:\\n\\\"The issue of jurisdiction is very fundamental as it goes to the competence of the Court or tribunal. If a Court or tribunal is not competent to entertain a matter or claim or suit, it is a waste of valuable time for the Court to embark on the hearing and determination of the suit, matter or claim. It is therefore an exhibition of wisdom to have the issue of jurisdiction or competence determined before embarking on the hearing and determination of the substantive matter. The issue of jurisdiction being a fundamental issue, it can be raised at any stage of the proceedings in the Court of first instance or in the appeal Courts.\\\" DALYOP V. STATE (2013) LPELR 21898 CA.\\n\\nIt is argued for the respondent that Section 11 (2) of the Legal Aid Act 2011 provides cover to the respondent, the said section for the avoidance of\\n\\n14\\n doubt reads in relevant part:\\n\\\"in assessing a person's means such of his commitments as may be prescribed, shall be deducted from resources, which would otherwise be his means.\\\"\\n\\nNow this provision of the Act could have provided cover for the respondent in view of the fact that his earnings far exceed the required minimum, by his own admission; as a matter of fact he would by reason of this provision have been considered an indigent person; but this provision is immaterial now, it cannot avail the respondent, in view of the finding that the respondent failed to provide the requisite approval of the board to entitle him to representation, the provision now counts for little or next to nothing in the circumstances.\\n\\nThe trial Court's finding at pages 307 and 308 of the record of proceedings to the effect that the respondent was rightly entitled to legal aid is faulty and erroneous because \\\"...where a statute or rules of Court prescribe a condition precedent to the assumption of jurisdiction, that condition precedent must be fulfilled before there is jurisdiction. A case must therefore come before the Court only when initiated by due process of law\\n\\n15\\n and upon fulfillment of any condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction.\\\" AGBOOLA V. AGBOOLA (2009) 37 QRN at 69. \\n\\nClearly legal aid is not granted viva voce, and the best way of establishing board approval as contended is to make available to the trial Court the said approval; in this case there is nothing on the record before the trial Court to show the respondent obtained the necessary approval, and yet the trial Court believed the respondent hook line and sinker, when he merely claimed the board gave him approval. What happened to \\\"when?\\\" and how?\\\"\\n\\nJurisdiction as it is often said is the be all, and end all, it cannot be premised on whether its assumption will prejudice a party to a case or not; the argument that the appellant will not be prejudiced if the respondent were allowed to be represented by the legal aid, regardless of whether he qualified for it or not begs the question; it is not about the effect of his representation on the appellant, it is about whether the statutory requirement has been met or not. And clearly it has not been met, by any account. Accordingly this issue is resolved in favour of the appellant and against the\\n\\n16\\n respondent.\\n\\nHaving resolved that the trial Court was robbed of jurisdiction, it makes little sense to proceed to resolve the other issues for determination left, because it is after all an exercise in futility; but be that as it may, I will proceed to determine them, assuming on the outside chance that I am wrong.\\nISSUE TWO: Whether the trial Court properly evaluated facts pleaded. \\n\\nIt is argued for the appellant that the evidence before the trial Court, with regard to the site of the alleged accident, whether it was a bend of close to a bend; same with the sketch map, Exhibit C19.\\n\\nIt does appear that the pleadings as contained in page 294 of the record, examined by the trial Court and supported by the evidence of CW1 was neither challenged nor controverted by the appellant; and as contended for the respondent in civil cases, where proof is on preponderance of evidence, a party cannot safely fail to lead evidence in rebuttal, because a matter that is not traversed remains a fact to be held against the other side, see FAGBENRO v AROBADI (2006) 7 NWLR part 978 at 172.\\nWhere evidence given by a party to a proceeding was not challenged by\\n\\n17\\n the other side who had the opportunity to do so, it is always open to the Court seized of the matter to act on such unchallenged evidence before it, ASAFA FOODS FACTORY V. ALRAINE NIG. LTD (2002) NWLR part 781 at 353.\\nThe evidence of witnesses who testified before the trial Court, which had the opportunity of listening to such witnesses and observing their demeanours is always better left to the trial Court which had the opportunity to watch and listen first hand; It is trite law that the evaluation of evidence adduced in a trial by a witness, and the ascription of probative value to such evidence are matters within the exclusive competence of the trial judge who has the advantage of seeing the witnesses, of watching their demeanour, and of hearing them give evidence: SULE O. ASARIYU v THE STATE (1987) 4 NWLR (Pt.67) 709.\\nThat being the case, failure to call the police who investigated the alleged accident or the Vehicle inspection Officer who all testified at the Magistrate Court, page 262 and 277 of the record of proceedings were properly excluded from the civil trial by the lower Court. The Supreme Court in ABUBAKAR v. JOSEPH (2008) 13 NWLR\\n\\n18\\n (Pt.1104) 307 held that record of proceedings in a criminal proceedings should not be admitted in evidence in a civil proceeding.\\nThe evaluation of the evidence that emanated from those records cannot be faulted in the circumstances either, especially the findings at page 302 that \\\"...in the light of the whole evidence before me... I am satisfied that the claimant has satisfactorily established negligence and damages against the 1st and 2nd defendants.\\\" Accordingly this issue is resolved for the respondent, against the appellant.\\n\\nIssue three: whether the trial Court's reliance on the evidence of CW1/respondent on the repair of his vehicle proper. \\n\\nThe appellant's grouse here is that there was no analysis on the nature of damage to the respondent's vehicle but only the claim that he incurred an expenditure of N293, 000 in fixing it; that the facts stated were not detailed or specific enough to warrant an award in specific damages; and therefore wrong for the Court to rely merely on the receipts tendered. \\n\\nThe respondent pleaded the damage and expenditure incurred in Paragraphs 15 and 30 of the amended statement of claim at page 207 of the\\n\\n19\\n record of proceedings; same was also pleaded in the statement on oath of CW1 at Paragraph 18. \\n\\nThe receipts evidencing the expenditure were tendered and admitted as Exhibits C15 to C18, see page 310 of the record of proceedings; these are all details of the expenditure incurred in fixing the alleged damage to the vehicle. That much is clear to this Court. \\n\\nDamages are classified generally into general and special damages. General damages are damages which the law in its wisdom, presumes to flow automatically from the wrong inflicted on a claimant by a defendant from whom they are claimed and do not need or have to be specifically, pleaded, see ARAB CONSTRUCTION LTD &amp; ANR V. ISAAC (2012) LPELR (CA).\\nSpecial damages on the other hand are specific and peculiar losses suffered or incurred as a result of the wrongful act or contract of a defendant. They are special in the sense that they are easily discernible and quantifiable and do not rest on a puerile conception or notion, which give rise to speculation or assumption. See XTOUDOS SERV. NIG. LTD. v. TAISEI (W.A.) LTD. (2006) ALL FWLR (333) 1640.\\n\\nThe trial Court in the considered\\n\\n20\\n opinion of this Court properly evaluated Exhibits C15 to C18 and properly concluded at page 298 of the record of proceedings that \\\"Exhibits C15 to C18 lend credence to the evidence of CW1 that his vehicle was damaged and that he carried out repairs...\\\"\\n\\nThe trial Court did not in the circumstances of this case require the evidence of a Vehicle Inspection Officer of policemen to come to the conclusion it did, righty so; the production of receipts to cover payments on expenditure incurred is sufficient proof of damage. \\\"It is trite law that where a claimant specifically alleges that he suffered special damages he must perforce prove it. The method of such proof is to lay before the Court concrete evidence demonstrating in no uncertain terms easily cognizable the loss of damages he has suffered so that the opposing party and the Court as an umpire would readily see and appreciate the nature of the special damage suffered and being claimed.\\\" See ADEGBOYE V. SALAWU (2013) LPELR 22140 (CA).\\n\\nThis issue is resolved in favour of the respondent without much ado. \\n\\nEven though two of the three issues for determination were resolved in favour of the respondent,\\n\\n21\\nand against the appellant, the appeal succeeds by reason of the fact that the first issue resolved in favour of the appellant robbed the trial Court of jurisdiction to hear and determine the case before it. Accordingly the appeal succeeds; the decision of the trial Court is set aside, because the proceedings were a nullity ab initio.\\n\\nParties to bear their respective costs.MOORE ASEIMO ABRAHAM ADUMEIN, J.C.A.: I read before now the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Mohammed Mustapha, JCA. My lord has elaborately dealt with the issues in this appeal.\\n\\nI agree with the reasons and conclusions of my learned brother.\\n\\nI also allow this appeal and set aside the decision of the lower Court.\\n\\nI abide by order as to costs.\\n\\nTINUADE AKOMOLAFE-WILSON, J.C.A.: I read in draft the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Mustapha, JCA. I am in complete agreement with his reasoning and conclusion in allowing this appeal. I hereby make a few comments.\\n\\nThe Legal Aid Council was established as welfarism for the poor so as to assist indigent persons who have cases in Court but do not have the means to prosecute them\\n22\\nhence the dispensation with payment of filing fees because it is the Government per se that prosecutes the cases on behalf of such indigent persons.\\nSection 10(4) of the Legal Aid Act, 2011 provides-\\n\\\"The rules of any Court relating to payment of fees shall not apply to a person granted legal aid.\\\"\\nThe respondent claimed to be an indigent person and that the Legal Aid Council Board approved is representation under the Act.\\nThere was no iota of proof supplied by the respondent that the Board approved his representation or that he was qualified to be a beneficiary of legal assistance under Section 10(1) (2) and (3) of the Legal Aid Act. It was therefore mandatory for him to have paid all the required filing fees for instituting this action in Court.\\nSection 10(1) (2) and (3) of the legal Aid Act 2011 provide -\\n\\\"(1) Legal aid shall be granted to a person whose income does not exceed the national minimum wage.\\n(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of (1) the Board may in exceptional circumstances grant legal aid services to a person whose earning exceeds the national minimum wage.\\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section\\n23\\n (1), the governing board may approve the giving of legal aid on a contributory basis to a person ten times the national minimum wage...\\\"\\nThe respondent, who was the claimant at the lower Court stated in evidence that he is a Senior Official of the Legal Aid Council on Grade level 14 with two cars.\\nThe onus of proof was on him to prove that he was indigent and that the Board indeed approved his representation. This ipxe dixit statement that there was such approval was not sufficient proof in the circumstances.\\nPayment of filing fees is a condition precedent to the Court's assumption of jurisdiction. Where filing fees are not paid, a Court of law will have no jurisdiction to entertain the matter before it. This is so because the payment of appropriate filing fees is a mandatory provision of the Rules of Court.\\nFailure to pay the prescribed fees in this suit therefore robbed the Court the jurisdiction to adjudicate on the case and thus renders the proceedings in the lower Court a nullity - In Okolo v. U.B.N Ltd. (2004) 3 NWLR (Pt. 859) 87 at 95, the Supreme Court held as follows-\\n\\\"...it cannot be over-emphasized that\\n\\n24\\n for a valid and effective commencement of a claim, an intending plaintiff shall strictly comply with the provisions of relevant statutes and the rules made thereunder and governing the claims made such as the High Court Law and the Rules of Anambra State. It is the responsibility of the plaintiff inter alia to pay the requisite fees in respect of each and every relief claimed as prescribed by the rules to enable the Court's judicial functions to commence. \\nA Court shall not entertain a relief claimed without payment of the prescribed requisite fee unless such fees have been waived or remitted by the Court or such fees are payable by any Government Ministry or non-Ministerial Government Department or Local Government pursuant to the provisions of the said High Court Rules of Anambra State. If the default in payment is that of the plaintiff, the claim in respect of such prescribed fees have not been paid cannot be said to be properly before the Court and should be struck out in the absence of an appropriate remedial action or application to regularize such anomaly. \\nIn this present case, no payment whatsoever was made by the appellants in respect of\\n\\n25\\n their new claim for forfeiture. Payment of the prescribed fees being a condition precedent to the filing of a valid claim before the Court, it seems to me clearly that the claim for forfeiture in the present suit is incompetent, improperly before the Court and ought to be struck out.\\\"\\n(Underlining mine)\\nSee Fada v. Naomi (2002) 4 NWLR (pt. 757) 318 at 334-335, Paras. C-B; Onwugbufor v. Okoye (1996) 1 NWLR (pt. 424) 252 at 292, Paras, A-C.\\nIn the instant case, the respondent did not pay the prescribed filing fees on the unsubstantiated contention that he was qualified to be a beneficiary of the Legal Aid Council legal services. In the absence of any such proof, it was mandatory for the respondent to pay the necessary filing fees. In the circumstances the trial Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the matter.\\n\\nWith these few comments and the more detailed reasons adumbrated by my learned brother in the lead judgment, I also allow this appeal. I abide by the consequential orders as to costs.\\n\\n26\\nAppearances:                                                      Obinna Okereke, Esq.
